always use flex property do not use width or height.

This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis)
    are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single number value, like flex: 5;, that changes the 
    flex-basis to 0%, so itâ€™s like setting flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;.

Also if we use flex-shorthand first and then set some width, it will not work as flex-basis overwrite sthe width and flex:1
    sets the flex-basis to 0.
