horizontal margins do not collpase.
switching language writing mode, switches the margin collpasing direction.

it would be more accurate to say that only block-direction margins collapse.

Margin collapse is unique to Flow layout. If you have children inside a display: flex parent, those children's margins will
    never collapse.


margin collpasing behaviour -

    a)Nesting doesn't prevent collapsing
    b)but empty space between last child and parent stop's margin collpasing.
    c)Blocked by a scroll container
    d)positive and negative margins cancel each other.
