2 ways to load - write separate file or write under script tag.

loading multipe files in a single webpage has performance issues as there is limit in convurrent request.
but writing all code in single files also has issues like scope, readability etc.

solution -
    1)IIFE solve the scope problem. we used revealing module pattern to do so. then we started writing code wrapped in IIFE in 
    multiple files and started bundling them togather in one file ad then load that our html. tools like make, grunt, gulp and 
    brocolii did this only.they are called bundleres.

Problems in solution -
    1)Changing one file means you need to concatinate all files again.
    2)Dead code is also shipped. if you are using lodash you import entite lodash library. that is aorund2-3 mb of code.
    3)IIFE are slow. IIFE force js engines to eager parse the code, so you incurr much  more intensive or costly  parsing time
    when your js is loading. which leads to slow loading apps.
    4)no lazy loading.
