/**
 *a component is a bundle of markup, styles, and logic that controls everything about a specific part 
    of the user interface.


    method of reuse -
        html - partial
        css - classes
        js -  functions

    With React, components are the main mechanism of reuse. Instead of partials for HTML, classes for 
    CSS, and functions for JavaScript, we create a component that bundles up all 3, and allows us to
    create a library of high-level reusable UI elements.
