All functions remember the Lexical Environment in which they were made. Technically, thereâ€™s no magic here: all functions have the 
    hidden property named [[Environment]], that keeps the reference to the Lexical Environment where the function was created.
The [[Environment]] reference is set once and forever at function creation time.
