default size of images are their minimum width, so flex-shrink and flex-grow cannot shrink below that.

We can solve it by givng intrinisic width or min-width of 0%.


but better solution is to not use images as direct child of flexbox, instead wrap them in a div and then use them. we gave width of
    100% to image. Now container will adjust it's width according to flex-grow or shrink, image will also adjust alomg with it.
    also container will be stretched to occupy all, height of container.but image will maintain its aspect ratio.

Exercise -
    Problem image should scale with screen as of now its locked on particular width.
    After some min width image and reviews should come in different rows.
    top edge of image should be hidden or oved out.

    solution -
        a)img has its default size as min-width and cannot shrink below that.It was solved with using a wrapper around image and 
            giving it width of 100%.
        b)this was solved using giving min-width to img using flex-wrap: wrap on container.
        c)since image always scaled to fill its container, as we have not given height then image maintains it's aspect ratio.
            we can use ibject-position to move the image.so we used negative value to move it to right.
