Webpack is static module bundler.

1)Here we saw that we can run webpack without any initial confguration. By default it makes suome assumptions about entryFile and where it places final build.
    npx webpack

2)Then we used this command to get details -

    npx webpack --stats detailed
3)Then we create a file- webpackConfig.js. and added a command in npm scripts.
