creating 2 separate build configs -
    then we created 2 separate webpack configs for prod and build. and added scripts in package.json to run them separately.
    in scripts we mentioned different configs using config file.

webpack-dev-server -
    npm i webpack-dev-server --save-dev

    then we added the webpack-dev-server in webpack.dev.config in devServer property.passed it some options.

    then we chnages the command to start webpack(now we want to use webpack-dev server) -
        "dev": "webpack serve --config webpack.dev.config.js --hot"
