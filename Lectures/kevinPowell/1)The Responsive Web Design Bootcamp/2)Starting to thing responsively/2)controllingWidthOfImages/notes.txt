if we simply use a image , it's width and height will be eqaul to its orignal one. but we can control it
    by giving width to image. so adjust it's height automatically to maintains it's ratio. dnt set both
    (width and height) on image as it will chnage aspect ratio of image and it will look weird. so make
    width as 100%, to make it fit in container. in code we do this-

    img {
        width: 100%
    }

Somee times what we want is we do not want our image to get bigger than its orignal size, but it can get smaller
    to fit in container. in that case use this-

    img {
        max-width: 100%;
    }
