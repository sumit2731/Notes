The prototype creational pattern is used to instantiate objects with some default values using an existing object. It clones
 the object and provides the existing properties to the cloned object using prototypal inheritance.In prototypal inheritance,
  a prototype object acts as a blueprint from which other objects inherit when the constructor instantiates them. Hence, 
  any properties defined on the prototype of a constructor function will also be present in the cloned object it creates.



  On Prototype only functions should be added. so in challenge we use constructor pattern for creating instance properties
  and Prototypal proeprties for storing functions. it helps us saving the space.
