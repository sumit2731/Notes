In Jasmine tests are known as specifications or specs and they are grouped in test suites.
angular test bed utility, it allows us to provide dependeicies to our services by using
dependecy injection
diffrent tests(it blocks) should be isolated from each other, this is done by using beforeEach block,
which reinitalizes all variables before each test needs. each test gets its own testingModule, with
it's own private isntance of calculator service and loggerSpy.

Tests should use dependecy injection pattern as much as possible. this will be more useful when testing more 
complex services and components.
jasmine utilities-
 xdescribe - desables this test suite(0 out of 2 ran)
 xit - disbales this test suite
 fdescribe - will only execute this test suite. f means focus
 fit - will execute only this test suite

npm run server
npm start
ng test - It compiles all application code as well as specification code and it is also going to run our specification using
 karma test runner.karma is used internally by angular cli. ng test is also going to launch an instance of  the chrone browser
 where test are being run
ng test --no-watch
