The accessibility tree is built using the DOM and it will be later used by the assistive devices to parse and interpret the 
content of the webpage we are visiting.ACT is like a semantic version of the DOM and it gets updated every time the DOM gets
updated. Each DOM element that needs to be exposed to assistive technologies will have a corespondent node in the ACT. Until
the ACT is not built.
