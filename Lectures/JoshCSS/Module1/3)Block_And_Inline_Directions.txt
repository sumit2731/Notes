CSS builds its sense of direction based on this system. It has -
    a block direction (vertical)S
    an inline direction (horizontal).


    Logical properties -
        margin-block - vertical axis
        margin-inline - horizontal axis
        
        margin-top => margin-block-start
        margin-bottom => margin-block-end
        margin-left => margin-inline-start
        margin-right => margin-inline-end

        These alternatives are known as logical properties.It's not just margin: there are logical variants for padding,
            border, and overflow as well.
