Cornell Notes -
    Step 1 - 
        a)media query syntax.
        b)media query merges rules does not exclude earlier rules
        c)media query does not affect specificity. so media query styles should come after normal styles, otherwise 
            media queries, wnt be able to replace them.
        d)using media query in styled components
            advantage- All styles that apply to a component are avalible at single place only.

        e)mobile vs desktop first approach -
            mobile first approach is preferred if you are also designing the project,but it depends on your use case.
            the most important thing is to be consistent with the approach.


        f)mixing patterns - shuld be avoided

            a)I believe that our applications should be either mobile-first or desktop-first. If we consistently use a single
                set of media queries, it'll help us quickly scan chunks of CSS to understand the structure.

            b)code snippet to avoid mixing pattern. use of revert keyword.
            c)sometimes its okay to avoid mobile first and desktop first approach, for ex- tablet approach.
                only goal - shoud be easy to understand

        g)media query units - earlier josh used px now he uses rem's. this means media query should be affected by user's
            choosen font-size.
            example - his own website


    Step 2 -
        questions - 
            a)syntax of screen width media queries?
            b)where media queries should be written as relative to normal quesries?
            c)how to write media quesries in case of styled components? 
            c)approachs to write media quesries?
            d)units of writing media quesries and why they should be used?
