1)attr()
    Using his function in css we can refer to value of data-something attribute.Limitation is
        this property can only be used to set the content property only.

    html -
        <div data-sumit="someText"></div>

    css -
        [data-sumit]:before {
            content: attr(data-sumit)
        }

2)var()
    It allows us to use custom css property

    .parent {
        --propertyName: blue;
    }
    .child {
        color: var(--propertyName)
    }

3)calc - this is function that lets you do that lets you do addition, subtraction, division, 
    and multiplication on various CSS units.it allows you to combining different css units.

        .class {
            --someVariable: 10px;
            width: calc(100vw - 30px);
            width: calc(100% - 30px);
            width: calc(var(--someVariable) + 30px)
        }

    In calc you can also convert a value that has no units to a value with units by just
        multiplying the value by 1 of the unit type you want to convert to -


        .class {
            --fav-num: 3;
            width: calc(var(--fav-num) * 1px);
        }

    Spacing in calc -
        You must have one space between each of the values in the calc function and the operation
            between them. This means you cannot have your value touch the operator. You also cannot
            have a space before the parentheses of the calc function. For example all of the 
            following are invalid CSS.


            .class {
                width: calc(1px+ 2px);
                width: calc(1px +2px);
                width: calc(1px+2px);
                width: calc (1px + 2px);
            }

4)clamp - You can specify minValue, normalValue and maxValue
