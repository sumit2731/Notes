here we saw that for popup etc we should use librray's like reach UI. these libarries use portals to render dialogs as a 
    result these porats will be rendered on top of any component that is in main app and not having any z-index(because later
    element comes on top, and portals are rendered after root element).
    
    then we saw that sometimes we have to use z-index in some elements inside root component. for these
    cases we can create a separate stacking context for root elmement and not give it some z-index. now as portal has zindex, 
    it will always come above any element in root component.
