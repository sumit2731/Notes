Fig 1,2 -
    memory allocated only when you use new keyword.i.e space for instance variable is allocated
        when you use 'new' keyword.
    before that only refrence variables are created, there is no instances.when object
    refrences are not pointing to anything else, then it has value of null.

    so a object refrence can either point to object instance or contain value null(It means
        it is not pointing to anything else)


Fig 4,5 -
    variable shadowing - instance varibles being shadowed by method arguments.
    we can access instnace variable directly in class method but to avoid variable shadowing
        we use this to access them

    solution - use this

fig 6,7 -
    constructor syntax.
    we can access member variables directly of use this

    we can call other constructor form constructor by using this


Fig 9 -
    Copy Constructor pattern - When a constructor accepts argument of its own type and uses it
        to initiatlize the instance.


Fig 10 -
    Java uses "call by value". but implications of passing a object id different.
