76)Mocking global Values & Functions

    see https.test.js to see howw to mock functions on global object in vitest.

    In jest this can be done using spyon.spyOn returns a mock function, which we can configure mockimplementation and return
    value. see link in bookmarks.


78)Test Specififc mocking
    see seoncd test of http.test.js, here in mock we are rejecting the promise, if passed data is not stringified.
    here we wanted to ensure that in code we are stringifying the data before calling fetch.

    And that is really the mindset you should get into when writing tests that you really build yourself an environment
        that allows you to test the parts of your code you wanna test.


79)Mocking Selected Places
    See third test of http.test.js, Here we mocked the return value for some one time only.
    in jest same can be done for mockedFunction returned with jest.spyOn(object, function)

80)Using local mock values
     see posts.test.js.

     Now you could think that for testing, we need to use form dataand you could, you could build your own form data object
        but you actually need a form element,a DOM element to do that. And whilst there would be ways of making this work
        you will learn more about the DOM in the next section.It might be a bit too complex here.

    So we setup our argument in muach a way that it has get method.that's the mindset I wanna get you into.
    Look at the code you wanna test and think about what behavior you wanna test and then build a testing environment
    that allows you to test those things.
