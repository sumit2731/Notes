1)String.fromCharCode() - returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units.
    String.fromCharCode(num1[, ...[, numN]]) - A string of length N consisting of the N specified UTF-16 code 
    units.

2)charAt() - method returns a new string consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit located at the specified offset 
    into the string.

3)endsWith - The endsWith() method determines whether a string ends with the characters of a specified string, returning 
    true or false as appropriate.

    str.endsWith(searchString[, length])
    length - If provided, it is used as the length of str. Defaults to str.length.

4)includes - The includes() method determines whether one string may be found within another string, returning true 
    or false as appropriate.

    str.includes(searchString[, position])

    position - The position within the string at which to begin searching for searchString. (Defaults to 0.)

    return value - true or false

5)indexOf - The indexOf() method returns the index within the calling String object of the first occurrence of the 
    specified value, starting the search at fromIndex. Returns -1 if the value is not found.

    str.indexOf(searchValue [, fromIndex])


6)The lastIndexOf() method returns the index within the calling String object of the last occurrence of the specified 
    value, searching backwards from fromIndex. Returns -1 if the value is not found.

    str.lastIndexOf(searchValue[, fromIndex])

        searchValue -A string representing the value to search for. If searchValue is an empty string, then fromIndex
         is returned.
        
        fromIndex -The index of the last character in the string to be considered as the beginning of a match. The 
            default value is +Infinity. If fromIndex >= str.length, the whole string is searched. If fromIndex < 0,  
            the behavior will be the same as if it would be 0.






1)split -The split() method divides a String into an ordered set of substrings, puts these substrings into an array, 
    and returns the array.  The division is done by searching for a pattern; where the pattern is provided as the 
    first parameter in the method's call. for method details refer docs.
        
        str.split([separator[, limit]])  

2)slice - The slice() method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.
    str.slice(beginIndex[, endIndex])

        beginIndex- 
            the zero-based index at which to begin extraction. If negative, it is treated as str.length + beginIndex. 
            (For example, if beginIndex is -3 it is treated as str.length - 3.)If beginIndex is greater than or equal to 
            str.length, slice() returns an empty string.

        endIndex -
            The zero-based index before which to end extraction. The character at this index will not be included.If endIndex
                is omitted, slice() extracts to the end of the string. If negative, it is treated as str.length + endIndex. 
                (For example, if endIndex is -3 it is treated as str.length - 3.)

3)substr - The substr() method returns a portion of the string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number
    of characters afterwards. 
    str.substr(start[, length]) 


3)charCodeAt() - returns an integer between 0 and 65535 representing the UTF-16 code unit at the given index.
