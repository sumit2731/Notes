5)I solved the question after having a incorrect solution, my solution and course's solution were exactly same.
6) quetsions was same as 5, but i took lot of time in solving, also some slight conditions were wrong, which i found while
    debugging only. also course solution is shorter and eliminates the need of maintaining sum.
    overall good problem.
7)code was right, you missed a important condition. even coding editor was not able to track the error. good question
8)totally blank with this question,visited it later.
9)dutchFlag problem - problem was very simple. but i cnt solve it because algo wa sbit complex.
10)solved this my myself but question was good. also in my solution there were some extra loops.
11)initially i understood the quwstion wrong and solved it. but later took some time to solve this.
12)algo wise i was blank. but when i saw algo in solution, then solved on my own. but dis'bt thought if edge case, i.e when array is
    already sorted.

2nd take -
5)solved it but has some typos.
6)I solve it. but i was doing lot of calculations to see difference and all, course solution maintains only difference, which makes
    calculations easier.Also i choose to solve it in same function instead of splitting it across 2 functions which reduced the number
    of comparisons.

7)I solved it, but just remeber that since we only need count, we can avoid one extra loop whch actually finds extra elements.
8)solved it.
9)Dutch problem - I solved it after making some mistakes. now i have more clarity on this
10)solved it. but approach was copied from ealrier triplet problems
11)i solved it on my own
