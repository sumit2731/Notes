1) how we can  call methods on primitives if they are not objects.Also js engines are optimized to create wrapper object.
    so these operations are not costly.Also null and undefined have no corrosponding
    wrapper object, so in turn no method can be called on them. they are most primitives.
2)how does creative a primitve type normally and with constructor of that data type differ. it is advised to create
    primitives without constructor or if you want to use constructor then do not use new. 

3)see question in last.
