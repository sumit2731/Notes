Insertion sort-
    There are some things at which insertion sort is good at, so this is'nt one that is just good to know about.
    it's not just a good challenge. there are situations where this algo does well.

Algo-
    Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger half which is always sorted.instead of largest or
    smallest element at a time,it takes each element and places it where, it should go in sorted half.

    check figure(slide link- https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/elementary-sorting-algorithms#/14). here green part 
    is our sorted array.here we compare element which is to be placed with sorted array(green part). we compare it 
    starting from last element of green array.


Complexity -
    Worst Case - O(n*n)

Strength of Insertion Sort -
    Insertion sort is good at is online algorithm which is an algorithm that can work as data is coming in, as it 
    receives new data.it doesn't need to have entire array at once. like when peple can submit numbers online and
    we want to sort them, with insertion sort because the way it works that we are keeping one side of array sorted
    and we are inserting items one at a time, it does'nt matter what numbers  comes in, we can place it where it 
    needs to go.

    so because we keep one side of array sorted  and we insert things in appropriate place , it works well in 
    situation where data is coming live or streaming and you need to insert it in moment's notice.
