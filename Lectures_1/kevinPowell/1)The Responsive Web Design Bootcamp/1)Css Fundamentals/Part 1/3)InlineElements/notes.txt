span is very useful inline elements.

    1)we use it to style text. but it has no default styling and semantic meaning. so span tag does not add any 
        value or meaning. it just used to change how something looks like.
    2)Span by itself is little useless, normally we use a class on them to make it easy to target with css.
    3) In code we use it to chnage color of text.
