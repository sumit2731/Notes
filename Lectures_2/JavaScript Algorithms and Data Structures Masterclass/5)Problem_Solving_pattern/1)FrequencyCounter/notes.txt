we use objects to to basically store bunch of values and their frequencies. this is useful when you have multiple
    pieces of data and you need to compare them, to see if they have simlilar values. If they are analgrams of each
    other, if a value is contained inside another value.it solves thsose problems in O(n) as compared to easier solutions,
    which involve using nested loops that solve them in O(n*n).
