questions -

    multiple state updates in  section 4, lecture 52,58.

questions asked in course -

    1)lecture 54, component getting updated on each form value control change.

JSX syntax -

    1)class -> className
    2)click -> onClick
        all events are listen by 'on' + 'name of event in capital letter'
    3)style= "height: 100%"; padding: 20px"  =>  style= {{height: '100px', padding: '20px}}
        so while setting properties like bacjround-color either use -
            
            'background-color' (write property name within '')
            
            or 
            
            bakgroundColor (write js version of proeprtyName i.e camelcase version)

    4)attaching some multiple as well as stateic classes to jsx element -

        <div className = {`staticClass1 ${flag ? 'dynamicClass' : ''} staticClass2 `}></div>

        <div className = {`staticClass1 ${flag && 'dynamicClass'} staticClass2 `}></div>
