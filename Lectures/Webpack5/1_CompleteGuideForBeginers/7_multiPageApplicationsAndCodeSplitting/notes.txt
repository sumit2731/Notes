1)we created some additional files which kiwi-image in components.
2)then we created a separate entrypoints in prod level config.(entry property),
    which generated different bundles.

code1 changes -
All these changes are in webpack.prod.config.js - 

    3)then we added the name of chunkNme in generated output file- config.output.filename
        abd for css - changes were made in MiniCssExtractPlugin.
    4)difference between - hash, chunkhas, contenthash - MiniCssExtractPlugin
        https://medium.com/@web_developer/hash-vs-chunkhash-vs-contenthash-e94d38a32208

    5)but we saw that all our bundles(js and css) are included in same index.html we dot not want this.

    6)then we added separate instance of HtmlWebpackPlugin in plugin array to generate another html file,
        then we added chunks property to controls which chunk assets should be included in each html file.
        chunk names are taken from entryPoint.

    7)then we added a common lodash dependency(install npm package) for our page and generated the build. 
        there we found that size of both files was very large.if we change our file the user needs to download this large file again,
        inspite of fact that large part of it is not changed.

        then we told webpack to optimize all bundles via optimize property. now a common chunk is generated for webpack.
        in index.html now 2 chunks of js is included. if our code changes then user does not need to download the lodash code again.

        then we removed lodash from one our code and saw that it is no longer included in index.html file.so webpack only includes this
        extra bundle if it is required.
        
        we also saw how to read the webpack output.


code 2 changes -
    Then we removed the lodash and incldued reactjs. separate bundle was not getting generated for same. so we spcififed the minimum
        size after which a separate bundle should be genretaed for a package. default value is 30kb. see code2 for it.option
        chnaged was optimization.


    Thing to be be looked into configs of splitChunk option. see things to be covered
