Padding -
    units - preffred ones are px, for padding and other box model properties like margin/border.
    see video. central idea is- we do not want padding/border/margin to chnage when font size is increased.
        changing the zoom level automatically scales everything.if padding also gets increased with bumping
        the font-size then height of container will increasing as there will be more lines of text.also
        consistent padding will mean that left indentation of all text is same.


    shorthand properties-
        we saw how to rest values are calculated when less than 4 values are provided
            padding
            margin
            border-style : dotted solid dashed solid
            border-radius: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left

Percentaga values - percentage values are always taken from parent's width.
