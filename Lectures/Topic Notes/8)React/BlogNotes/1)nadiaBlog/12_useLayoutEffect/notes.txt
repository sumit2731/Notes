changing elements based on real DOM measurements like the size or position of an element.


Before useLayoutEffect -
    we can hide the navigation bar then do calculations


Why don‚Äôt we just use it everywhere instead of useEffect? The docs explicitly say that useLayoutEffect can hurt performance and should
    be avoided. Why is that? It also says that it is fired ‚Äúbefore the browser repaints the screen‚Äù, which implies that useEffect is
    fired after. But what exactly does this mean from a practical sense? Do I need to think about low-level concepts like browser 
    painting when writing simple dropdowns now ü§Ø?
