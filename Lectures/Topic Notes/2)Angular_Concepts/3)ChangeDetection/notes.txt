Observations - 


    1)
        parent - OnpUsh
        child - Default

        whenever chnage detection happens in parent(event handler is called etc) it also happens in child.

    2)
        parent - OnPush
        child - OnPush

        If you call detechChnages in parent, then it will not trigger cnage detection in child, as child is using onPush.
            if child is using default chnage detection, then calling detect chnages on parent will also trigger change 
            detection in child.


    3) -
        parent - On Push
        child - On Push

        in paret setImeout runs and we are chnaging the refrence of input bound properties of child 1. but ngOnChes of child is
        not called, nor its view is getting updated. 
        
        Reason - As parent is using onPush, setTImeout will not trigger chnage detection in parent. as chnage detection is not 
            happening in parent it cannot happen in child.hence view is not updated.

            If you chnage refrence of input bound properties in event handler then, change detection of parent is triggered,
                as refrence of input bound properties is chnaged chnage detction is also triggered in child. however if
                just push new element in array in parent then child will not be updated as it is using ONpush, even if we call
                detectChanges in parent.

            If child is using default chnage detection then even without changing refrence of input bound proeprties of child 
            in event handler of parent(which uses onPush) will update the view.


    4)dettaching a view
        Any event handler(or anything else) will not fire chnage detection, only way is to manually call the detectChanges.
        calling change detection manually in parent will also trigger change detection in child(if child is not using on push
        change detection strategy).

        In above case calling markForCheck will not do anything i.e chnage detector will not fire in parent as well as child.
