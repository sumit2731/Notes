Reccursion is used in-
    1)JSON.parse and JSON.stringify
    2)DOM transversal
    3)Object Transversal
    4) to transverse advance data structure likes trees and graphs
    5)It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration

2 Things to do in reccursion -
    1)Calling fucntion again with diffrent argument(we call function again with smaller data)
    2)Breaking Condition(Base Case)

Types of recursion(last 2 lectures)-

    1)helper method reccursion(useful when need a variable to persist around multiple function calls, see code)
    2)pure reccursion
