The term “combinator” refers to a character that combines multiple selectors. In this case, the space character combines nav and a to 
create a descendant selector. types -

    a)descendant selector (space)
        .nav a {
            color: red;
        }

    b)child selector (>)
        .main-list > li {
            border: 2px dotted;
        }
        
        we are only targetting li tags which are direct childern of main-list. more complex setup -

        .main-list ul > li {
            border: 2px dotted;
        }
        
        here we are targetting the li tags which are direct childern of ul(which is descendant of .main-list)


extra form course -

    c)adjacent sibling selector (+)
    d)general sibling selector (~)
