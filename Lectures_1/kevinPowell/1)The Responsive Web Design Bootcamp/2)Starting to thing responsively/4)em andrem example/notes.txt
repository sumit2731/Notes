Now here we have buttons.they have font-size and padding. lets decreaase and increase their font size.
    so in first row - left button has large font size, second one is normal one(which was before we changed
    styles) and third one is smallest one. now you can see that for third one it lokks like padding is being 
    too much. this is because padding on button remains same while we chnaged font size.so we have to adjust
    padding also. this can be cumbersome now.

There is one solution, i.e if you can give padding in em units. thing with em units is, if we use them in 
    font-size, they refer to parent's font size. but if you mention them in any other property they refer 
    to that element's font-size. in second row of buttons we do this thing. so when we change font size of
    button, it's padding changes automatically.

same is true for margins - 
    
    h1 {
        font-size: 3rem;
        margin-buttom: 1.5em;
    }

so we just need to chnage font-size, margin and padding will chnage automatically.

we can also use percentages for setting font sizes but it will have same cascading effect as with em. so we dnt use
    % for same reason we dnt em for setting up font size.so we will use % to set only width.
