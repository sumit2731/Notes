187)what are 'custom hooks'
188)Creating a Custom React Hook Functions - 
    custom hook created in - hooks/use-counter.js
189)using custom hook function
    custom hooks used in ForwardCounter.js
190)congiguring custom hooks
    used same hook in BackwardCounter.js by cutomomizing our hook, that is it accepts a parameter.

191 ) here we have project 2. here app.js and NewTask.js, have similar logic of making api call and then updating loading 
    and error state we can outsource the logic into separate function, but since logic involves use of react state and 
    react hook, here normal function wnt do the trick because there we are not allowed to use hooks,so we need custom 
    hook as we have stateful logic here.

192)here we built a custom http hook. see code2/working2 for my solution.
    see code2/working for course solution.

193)here we used the customhook in app.js. there we also refactored our custom hook to fit useCase of app.js.
    how to avoid use of useCallbcak and useMemo by using argumnets instead of taking variables from closure. 
    if we take variable form closre then we have to make react maintains those values across render cycle, which 
    can be cumbersome some times.
