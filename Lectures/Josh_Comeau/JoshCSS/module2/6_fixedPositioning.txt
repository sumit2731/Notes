Incompatibility with certain CSS Properties
    a)If an ancestor (parent, grandparent, â€¦) uses the transform property, it stops being locked to the viewport.
        Here's what's happening here: By applying a transform to .container, it becomes the containing block for this 
        fixed-position child. As a result, it functions like an absolutely-positioned child.

    b)The same thing happens when we use the filter CSS property, as well as the will-change property.

    here is what happens -
        1)parent or grand parent with above properties becomes the containing block for absolute and fixed positioned 
            descendents.
        2)descendents with position fixed, do not remains fixed to viewport, they behave like position:absolute.

How to resolve the problem -
    
    a)You can try to remove or replace the CSS property (eg. for filter: drop-shadow, you can use box-shadow instead).
    b)If you can't change the CSS, you can use a portal, like we saw in the previous lesson, or otherwise find a way to
        move the fixed element to a different container.


Extra from lecture -
    percentage values are based on viewport width, irerespective of padding on html and body tag.


similarity with absolute position -
    default position
    Incompatibility with properties like transform,filter and will-change
diffrence with absolute -
    even on scroll position remains fixed
