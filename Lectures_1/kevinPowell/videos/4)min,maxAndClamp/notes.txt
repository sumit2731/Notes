1)min -

    width: 70%
    max-width: 600px

    min lets us write above 2 lines in single line-

    to min you can pass 2 or more values. let's stat with 2-

    width: min(500px, 70%)

        min is going to look for smaller of above 2 values at any given time. hence function is called min,
        because it is choosing min of 2 values. as you chnage browser width, it will pick one of 2 values depnding
        upon which one is minimum.


2)max- it picks the maximum value from given one.

    width: max(400px, 20%, 50vh);

    
3)min,max
    
    a)we can also use one inside another. i.e-

        max: (min(100px,vh),40%)

    b)also we can do math inside these without using calc.like this-

        min: (500px + 10%, 600px);
        for doing math , you need to have space on both sides of unit. i.e on left and right side of '+'.

4)clamp - It works with only  3 values. if you give it more or less, it wnt work.It's always a minimum, maximum and 
    ideal size(size that you would like it to be).it's like setting min-width, max-width and width on it, all 3 in
    1, which is pretty cool.

    clamp(min, ideal, max);

    width: clamp(200px, 50%, 20rem);

    so it wants to be of 50%, but it has minimum size of 300px and max size of 20rem.

    Kevin said that he is not big fan of min-width. as it can cause lot of issues. when you go to mobile, you have to 
        override them and the stuff like that. so kevin is not sure what are use cases of using clamp for width.

    then Kevin showed how he uses it. he uses it to set font-size.
    
    people set font-size like this-
    
        font-size: 1vh

    so now font size hcnages when browser window is hcnaged, but on very small window size it is not readable. user tries to
     zoo in, but as font size depends on vieport height, it remains same even on zoom in. see video for use cases.
     like that-

    font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 5rem); 14:35
