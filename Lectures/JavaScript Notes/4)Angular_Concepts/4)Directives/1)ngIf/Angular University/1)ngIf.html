<!-- Ways to hide elemnts in css
        dipplay:none
            Element is present in DOM but do not occupy any space in page
    
        visibility:hidden
            Ekement is present in DOM tree as well as it occupies some space


-->

<!-- 0. If you do not have a  container elment to apply *ngIf use ng-container -->
    <ng-container>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
    </ng-container>


<!-- 1. *ngIf directive with a single condition -->

    <div *ngIf="condition">
        This DIV is displayed when "condition" is true
    </div>

<!-- 2. [ngIf] with ng-template -->

    <ng-template [ngIf]="condition">
        <div>This DIV is displayed when "condition" is true</div>
    </ng-template>

    syntaxes #1 and #2 are 100% equivalent from an Angular compiler perspective.

    When to use that syntax? If we want to conditionally render two sibling elements that donâ€™t have a single 
        common parent in the DOM. For instance:

    <ul>
    <li>First item</li>
    <ng-template [ngIf]="showItemsTwoAndThree">
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ng-template>
    </ul>

<!--3. *ngIf with an else case -->

    <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">
        Content to render when condition is true.
    </div> 
    
    <ng-template #elseBlock>
        <div>Content to render when condition is false.</div>
    </ng-template>

<!--4. *ngIf with both then and else cases -->

    <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
    
    <ng-template #thenBlock>
        Content to render when condition is true.
    </ng-template>
    
    <ng-template #elseBlock>
        Content to render when condition is false.
    </ng-template>

    Note that in the above example, the parent div is actually not rendered.

<!-- 5. Storing a conditional result in a variable -->

    <div *ngIf="(userObservable$ | async) as user; else loading">
        Hello {{user.last}}, {{user.first}}     
    </div>     
    
    <ng-template #loading>
        Loading user info...
    </ng-template>

    <!-- 
        The values emitted by the Observable are going to be available inside the scope of the ngIf directive via the user local 
        template variable. 
        
        advantages of using async pipe -
            the pipe will take care of unsubscribing from the Observable automatically when the component gets destroyed.
            component view will get automatically updated with the latest Observable data if using OnPush change detection.
    -->

<!--6. ngIf and async - Anti pattern - here see combined useage of ngIf and async pipe just to get some data

-->

    <div class="header" *ngIf="(user$ | async) as user">

        ... this section of the page only needs the user ...
        
    <button *ngIf="!user">Login</button>
        
    <button *ngIf="user.loggedIn">Logout</button>    
        
    </div>

    
    <div class="body" *ngIf="(courses$ | async) as courses">

        <ng-container *ngIf="(lessons$ | async) as lessons"> 
        
            ... we also need the user here again ...
        
            <ng-container *ngIf="(user$ | async) as user">
            
                ... this section of the page needs courses, lessons, and the user ....
            
            </ng-container>
        
        </ng-container>

    </div>

    
    <div class="footer" *ngIf="(courses$ | async) as courses"> 

        <ng-container *ngIf="(lessons$ | async) as lessons">
            
            ... this section of the page only needs the courses and the lessons ...     
            
        </ng-container>

    </div>

<!-- 7. Solution to above- "The Single Data Observable pattern" -->


    <ng-container *ngIf="(data$ | async) as data">
        
        <div class="header">
            ... access the user via data.user ...
        </div>
        
        <div class="body">
            ... access the data via data.user, data.courses, data.lessons ...
        </div>
        
        <div class="footer">
            ... access the data via data.courses and data.lessons ...
        </div>
    </ng-container>


    This Observable contains all the data that the component template will need throughout its lifecycle, which explains the name of 
    the pattern. here when we get response from api data$ emits a value, which makes some data to be visisble.
