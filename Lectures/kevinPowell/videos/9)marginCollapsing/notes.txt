with display:flex or grid , we do not see collpasing margins.

solution for margn collpasing -
    1)use dislay:flow-root, on parent
    2)break direct contact between 2 margins, i.e give padding or border.
    3)using universal selector you can make margin of all elemnts as 0.
    4)use this selector to select all childern other than first child -
        h1, h2, h3, p {
            margin: 0;
        }
        .flow > * + * {
            margin-top: 1em
        }

        now whenever you give this class to parent all elemnts except first child will have same margin. there is another 
            selector for this also, but it more specificity, so it is not recommended -

        .flow > *:not(:first-child) {}
