Here we gave flex-wrap as well as flex-basis. so our items moves to next row, if there is not enough space. so there are 2 items on
    each row then next item moves to next row, because there is not enough space. but after 2 items there is empty space.we can
    use flex-grow to fill that space.

Here flex-shrink have no role because flex-wrap is on and bacuse of that our item will move to next row if there is not enpugh space.
    our item will start shrinking when there is only one ite in row and there is not enough width of screen to even accomodate
    one item.

so flex-grow,flex-shrink flex basis only work on row they are. here our third item only occupies the space in that row because 
    of flex-grow. items in next or previous rows are not disturbed by it.

folder 2 shows same thing when main aixs is vertical.
