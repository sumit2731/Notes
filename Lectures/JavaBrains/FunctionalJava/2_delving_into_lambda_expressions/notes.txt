Introducing Lamdba Expression
    see figure 1. here we are assigning a function to a variable.

Lambda Expression Examples
    figure 4 - here we are not giving type to argument, because it will get
        it from left hand side expression.
    you can skip the parenthesis when you have only 1 argument.
    If you do not have {} then it returns whatever is in single statement.

    which is better Object oriented programming or Functional programming -
        some problems are easy to solve in functional programming, some are easy to solve in OOPs.
        Once you learn tools that you have at your displosal for functional programming, you will know where
        functional programming shines, it is not suited for all kind of problems.In Java default programming 
        is OOPS, functional programming is additional tool that is made avalible to you. you cnt just avid OOP
        and do only functional programming in java, it not even possible in java.so its never either-or question.
        if you are working with java, you are doing OOP, choice is would you like to use fucntional programming 
        paradigms, while doing OOP. answer is yes, in certain situations it helps.


Functional Interfaces -
    no new functional type was introduced because they want to make java backward compatible i.e older
    versions of java can also use libraries written in Lambda expressions.

    Figure 5- 
        Lambda expressions are represented by Functional Interfaces.these are special type of interfaces.
        It is subtype of interface, special type of interface.but it has a rule -
            Functional Interface needs to have a Single Abstract Method (SAM). it means interfaces
            that have only one abstract method can be type for lambda expressions.it can have other
            methods which are implemented(default methods), but only one abstract method.you need to
            find type of lambda, look at abstract method in interface, that is type. you can have interface with only
            one abstract method, that is going to type the lambda. see figure 6.

        so we are using interfaces as a workaround to type the lambda.

Lambda handOn-coding -
    see tis file in code - LambdaExamles.java

    It looks like interface, It behaves like a interface but it is a lambda expression, JVM treats it differently.
    This is not a class, ypu can treat it as a class and execute it. this is done for backward compatibility.

    now in code see that these lambda expressions can be assigned to each other and when we run them, we get different
    behaviours.tyou can think of it as achieving different way what was possible with polymorphism,you say I will hold on to
    parent type and then pass in different types and i can execute a method on the type and get different behaviour.thing
    that you were doing there was, you were not passing different behaviours, you were passing different things that had 
    different behaviours and it should just execute on that string.here you are passing the behaviour itself.you execute behaviour
    itself rather than thing that has  a behaviour. there are no class instances being created here, no constructor being called.
    there is whole different JVM instruction code that is being used, that is actually for some different reasons.But it kind of
    reuses it and is little more efficient than creating class instances.
