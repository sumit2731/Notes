here we saw the trick to make equal size column, this can be used to divide sapce between any no of columns.
    we set flex-basis: 0 and then use flex-grow:1 to make them equal size.

Exercises -
    Here we has 3 columns of equal size using flexbox. On very small sizes we noticed that one column stops shrinking first 
    than others. this is because each column has implicit min-width depending on length of largest word.In solution we solved
    it using flex-basis:0px. now content started overflowing out from cflex-items.In real life we will solve these by -
        a)use media queries to use resolution on smaller screens
        b)use flex wrap to split them across multiple lines on smaller viewports.
