Negative Margins -
    With padding and border, only positive numbers (including 0) are supported. With margin, however, we can drop into the
    negatives.

        points covered -
            a)negative values of margin-top and margin-left allows you to draw the element closer to its top or left neighbour.
            b)nagative values of margin-bottom and margin-right, draw its right and bottom neighbour closer to it
            
            Trick - This trick is useful for subtle tweaks, where the content of one element should slightly overlap the content 
                of the one above it.
            c)margin-collpasing and negative values -
                a)If one is positive and one is negative, then negative is subtracted from positive.
                b)If both values are negtaive, then more negative values is subtracted from 0 and other one is ignored.
                In short negative margin-top and margin-bottom is not affected by margin collapsing.
            d)negative values in margin-left and margin-right -
                a)If width is fixed then negative left/right margin, works same as top/bottom negative margin.It just that
                    margin collpasing does not work on left/right margin.
                b)If width is auto, then other end does not move, but end on which negative margin is applied, moves such 
                    that with of element increases. this is trick using which child can occupt the padding of parent.
            Trick - . You give a container a padding so that its contents have some breathing space. However, you want the 
                header to span the entire container, ignoring the padding. Negative margins are the way to go.
    
    A negative margin can pull an element outside its parent.
    Negative margins can also pull an element's sibling closer.
    It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that margin is exclusively about changing the selected element's position. 
        Really, though, it's about changing the gap between elements. Negative margin shrinks the gap below an element, 
        causing the next element to scoot up closer.
    negative margin can affect the position of all siblings.

Margin-Auto -
    The auto value seeks to fill the maximum available space. It works the same way for the width property. the byproduct
    for this is that we end up horizontallyb centering the element by setting margin-left/right to auto. also we can push it to
    right with margin-left: auto.

    Two caveats:
        This only works for horizontal margin. Setting top/bottom margin to auto is equivalent to setting it to 0px*.
        This only works on elements with an explicit width. Block elements will naturally grow to fill the available 
            horizontal space, so we need to give our element a width in order to center it.
  
    note - margin: auto has no effect on display: inline/inline-block.with flex-box it moves individual flex-items.

    see question 2 at last, here trick is width: auto has a different meaning for replaced elements. It doesn't mean “stretch
        out and fill all of the space”, it means “use your natural width”!
