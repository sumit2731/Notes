Unfortunately, it's very common to apply position: sticky to an element, only for nothing to happen; the element won't stick!.
Let's look at some common reasons for this.

    a)A parent is hiding/managing overflow
        Here's how to think about it: position: sticky can only stick in one "context". If it's within a scroll container, it can
            only stick within that container.
    b)The container isn't big enough
         A sticky element will only follow the viewport as long as it remains inside its parent container.
            Make sure that your sticky element has room to move within its parent container.
    c)The sticky element is stretched
    d)There's a thin gap above my sticky header!
