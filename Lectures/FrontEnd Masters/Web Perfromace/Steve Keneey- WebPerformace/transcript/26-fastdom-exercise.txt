We ran through the entire array of those boxes slash bars. We measured them all, then we ran through the array a second time and mutated them all. Could we use FASTON, which is basically starting out with almost the original code we had, wrap that in the measure, and then for when we mutate it, wrap that in faston.mutate and let's see what the differences are.
