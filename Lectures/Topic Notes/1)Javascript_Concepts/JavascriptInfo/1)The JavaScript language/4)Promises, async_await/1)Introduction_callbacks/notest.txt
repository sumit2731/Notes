Points Covered -
    1) “callback-based” style of asynchronous programming - by implementing loading scripts example.
    2)error First Callback Approach
    3)Problems with callbacks - Pyramid of Doom, Callback hell.
        The “pyramid” of nested calls grows to the right with every asynchronous action. Soon it spirals out of 
        control.
    4)Solution to callbac hell - use induival functions
    5)drawaback of functions used in point - 
        a)Single use only
        b)code lookslike torn apart, is difficlut to read
