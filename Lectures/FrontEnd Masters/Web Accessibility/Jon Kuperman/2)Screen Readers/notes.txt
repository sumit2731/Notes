1)types if screen readers
2)Alternative text & captions
    screen readers start reading image source by default if alt is not provided. 
    so provide alt attribute as when alt attribute is provide screen reader will not read image src.
    In case of user uploaded image - 
        a)Give general text
        b)Give blank alt attribute as thos will prevent screen reader form reading src attribute.

    also i case of decrative images (like in corners) also giving empty alt and skipping reading src helps.

    If something is very vital for your website then you can provide empty alt attribute but you can provide a visually div
    hiddnen div which describes the image, which is invisible to normal users but visisble to screen readers.


    see image 1.

    when you focus over input screen redaers read the label for that.


    then at last we opened a html page in screen reader. at sw how wscreen reader reads the page.
