A service worker is a special type of web worker in JavaScript that runs in the background and acts as a proxy between a web
    browser and the internet.

    The service worker file is a JavaScript file that contains instructions for the service worker to follow. It includes an
    event listener for the install event, which is fired when the service worker is first installed.

    In the install event listener, the service worker can cache files and assets that are needed for the web application to
    work offline. This is done using the caches.open() and caches.addAll() methods.
