q1 - how ts linked d.ts files defined in @types/ with package name in ts
ans - 
    Automatic Type Acquisition
        TypeScript automatically looks for type definitions in the node_modules/@types directory. When you 
            import a package in your TypeScript code, the compiler searches for a matching @types package 
            without any additional configuration2.
        For example, if you import a package named foo-bar, TypeScript will automatically look for type definitions in:
            a)node_modules/foo-bar/index.d.ts
            b)node_modules/@types/foo-bar/index.d.ts
    TypeScript Compiler Behavior
        When the TypeScript compiler encounters an import statement or a reference to a module, it follows these 
        steps:
            a)Look for a .ts or .d.ts file with the same name as the module.
            b)Check the node_modules directory for a package with that name and look for its types/typings field in 
                package.json.(default is index.d.ts in same path as package.json)
            c)If not found, look in the node_modules/@types directory for a package matching the module name.

    Declaration Files Structure
        The main declaration file (index.d.ts) in an @types package typically uses the declare module syntax to
        define the shape of the module.

            declare module 'foo-bar' {
                export function someFunction(): void;
                export const someConstant: number;
                // ... other type definitions
            }

        This structure allows TypeScript to associate the type definitions with the correct module name when 
            it's imported in your code.

q2 - how to configure where ts looks for typeDefinations(d.ts files)
ans -
    a)All files which will be compiled by tsc, all d.ts files are included.
    b)The typeRoots option specifies directories where TypeScript should look for type definitions.
     If typeRoots is set, TypeScript will only look in the specified directories and will not automatically look in 
     node_modules/@types.if not defined ./node_modules/@types is default value, so it will look at that path
    c)it looks at types field in tsconfig, if it is not defined then all files under ./node_modules/@types are picked,
        otherwise =you can specify name of package and d.ts files of that package will be picked.
