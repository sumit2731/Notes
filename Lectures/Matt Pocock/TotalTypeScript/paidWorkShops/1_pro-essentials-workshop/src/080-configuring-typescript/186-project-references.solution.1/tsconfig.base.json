/*
  composite option in tsconfig -
    a)Enables the project to be referenced by other TypeScript projects via the references 
        field.
    b)Ensures that the project can be built incrementally, meaning only changed files are 
        recompiled.TypeScript generates a .tsbuildinfo file in the outDir. This file stores 
        metadata about the build and is used for incremental builds. hence very useful in 
        large projects.
    c)Requires certain settings in the tsconfig.json to ensure the project is compatible 
        with project references.
    d)Declaration files (.d.ts) are always generated, even if declaration is not explicitly set.
    e)Automatically builds dependent projects in the correct order when using tsc --build. if a project
        refers to another via refrence build then that project is build first.
