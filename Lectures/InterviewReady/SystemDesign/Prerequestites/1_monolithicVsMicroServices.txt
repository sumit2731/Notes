Monliths - same code can be run on different machines. these machine scan connect to multiple
    databases.

Microservices - client connect to gateway and then gateways connects to machines.



Moniliths advantages -
    a)small team, cannot get time to break it into microservices.
    b)Less complex, deployments are easy
    c)less code duplication.
    4)faster as you are not making rpc (remote procedure calls).

Monlithic Disadvantages -
    a)More context required for new person.
    b)frequent deployments, each time to touch a code, deployment needs to happen, and it needs to be
        monitored everytime, that it is working properly.
    c)tests are more complicated as everything is touching everything.
    d)single point failures. too much resposibility on one server, if one server crashes all of this
        crashes.


Microservices Disadvantages - 
    a)system is scalable, each services has its own database and iteract with other services.It is
        easier to design system in this way.
    b)easier for new team member.
    c)parallel development is easy.
    d)there are less hidden parts, you put more servers for service which is highly used.

Disadvantage of microservice -

    a)needed skilled architects to design this, if a microservices is only talking to one microservice,
        then both microservice need to be combined into one microservice.
