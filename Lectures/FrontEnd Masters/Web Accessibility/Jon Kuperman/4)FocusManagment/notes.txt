    expectation is that pressing tab should move to next button, if you want to move into drodown you need o press enter
    \and arrow keys.


storing focussed element in variable before a page transition, so that when traistion is done you can rteurn back to it.example is

 In modals escape key should close the modal or user shuld be able to tab to close icon. code in index.html of focus-management
