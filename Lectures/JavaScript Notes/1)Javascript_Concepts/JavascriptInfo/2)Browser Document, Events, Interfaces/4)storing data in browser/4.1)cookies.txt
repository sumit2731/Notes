1)Defination of cookies
    they are specific to domain
    cookies can be set via response headers or in js(we can disable via some options) also
    they are sent with each http call(almost each as these are not sent in CORS calls) to same domain
2)Uses of cookies in authentication
3)How to access cookies of a origin in a website - document.cookie
    The value of document.cookie consists of name=value pairs, delimited by ;. Each one is a separate cookie.

4)Writing to document.cookie -
    it is setter.A write operation to document.cookie updates only cookies mentioned in it, but doesn’t touch other cookies.

    document.cookie = "user=John";

    document.cookie = operation does not overwrite all cookies. It only sets the mentioned cookie user.

5)limits on cookie storge -
    should not exceed 4KB.
    The total number of cookies per domain is limited to around 20+, the exact limit depends on the browser.

6)cookie_option - Cookies have several options, many of them are important and should be set.
    document.cookie = "user=John; path=/; expires=Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT"

    a)path - The url path prefix must be absolute. It makes the cookie accessible for pages under that path. By default, it’s the 
        current path.If a cookie is set with path=/admin, it’s visible at pages /admin and /admin/something, but not at /home or 
        /adminpage.Usually, we should set path to the root: path=/ to make the cookie accessible from all website pages.

    b)domain - By default, a cookie is accessible only at the domain that set it. So, if the cookie was set by site.com, we won’t 
        get it at other.com. …But what’s more tricky, we also won’t get the cookie at a subdomain forum.site.com!


    c)expires, max-age - By default, if a cookie doesn’t have one of these options, it disappears when the browser is closed. Such 
        cookies are called “session cookies”.

    d)secure - The cookie should be transferred only over HTTPS.By default, if we set a cookie at http://site.com, then it also 
     appears at https://site.com and vice versa.That is, cookies are domain-based, they do not distinguish between the protocols.
     With this option, if a cookie is set by https://site.com, then it doesn’t appear when the same site is accessed by HTTP, as 
     http://site.com.

        document.cookie = "user=John; secure";

    e)samesite
        
        samesite=strict
        samesite=lax

    f)httpOnly - The web-server uses the Set-Cookie header to set a cookie. Also, it may set the httpOnly option.This option 
        forbids any JavaScript access to the cookie. We can’t see such a cookie or manipulate it using document.cookie.

7)third party cookies - A cookie is called “third-party” if it’s placed by a domain other than the page the user is visiting.
    Naturally, some people don’t like being tracked, so browsers allow to disable such cookies.


    Also, some modern browsers employ special policies for such cookies:

        Safari does not allow third-party cookies at all.
        Firefox comes with a “black list” of third-party domains where it blocks third-party cookies.
