3 Main Directories directories -

    Root Directory - locations -> macintosh HD
    Users Directory - you are inside users folder.
    Home Directory - you clicked on one user and you come to home directory.

    On starting terminal we enter home directory.

symbols -
    first / in outout of pwd means root directory.
    ~ in terminl means home directory. 
    when you move to a folder on left hand side of terminal always shows the folder name.

1)pwd - print working directory
    /Users/susood

    here first / means we are in root directory

2)cd -
    cd /
        takes to root directory
    cd ~ or cd
        takes to home directory
    cd /Users

    cd ..
        go one level up form current directory
    
    cd folder1/folder2
    
    cd someText - press tab
        it will try to autocomplete based on folders in directory. if there are more than one match, it will show you options,
            you can enter more text and then press tab.

    cd absolutePath
        cd /Users/susood/Postman
            takes to this path, no matter which path you are in.absolte path always starts form root

    special character -
        1)space - \
             folder 1 - cd folder\ 1

3)ls -
    gives the list of files and folder in current directory.

    flags -
        a)-s
            shows the size of files.
        b)-l
            gives the info in long format
        c)combining flags -
            ls -ls


3)clear 
    clear the shell

4)mkdir - creates a folder
    mkdir "foldername"

5)touch
    touch "fileName1" "fileName2"
    touch index.html app.js
    it touches the files and chnages the last modified date but if it cannot find the fileName , then it creates new file.

6)rm
    removes single/multiple files
    
    rm "fileName1" "fileName2"
    rm index.html app.js
        permanently deletes the file.

    flags -
        a)-r 
            recirsive flags it allows to remove folder with content.if folder is empty even then it can used to m=folders.

            rmdir -r project.




7)rmdir
    removes the folder which do not have files in them.

    rmdir project

    to remove folder with space (test project)-
        rmdir test\ project

8)man
    man commandName -> man ls
    list all the flags for given command and explanation for flags.

9)cp - copy comand
    cp path1 path2 => copies file in path1 to path2
    cp data/index.html copied/ => copies index.html to copied folder

    only one file can be copied at a time

    So if you want to refer to an existing folder,add the slash at the end of the folder name.



    you cannot copy folders for that you need to use -r flag.also .
    flags -
        1)-r
            r stands for reccursive, it copies the entire folder.

            cp -r data copied 
                copied folder will have data folder.
            cp -r data/ copied 
                copied folder will have contents of data folder, not data folder itself.
            cp -r data/ copied/
                same as above 
10)mv
    mv filePath1 filepath2 => moves file in location1 to location2.
    mv folderpath1 folderPath2 => moves folder form one path to another.

    we can move files and folder, but we cannot move contents of folder, like we saw with cp command.

    So if you want to refer to an existing folder,add the slash at the end of the folder name.

    using mv you can also do renaming of file => mv styles.css style.css
