        a)How to styleProjected content
        b)how to get events of projected content

    e)Solution to the above problems -

        a)styling projeced content -
            use :host and ::ng-deep -

                :host ::ng-deep input {
                    border: none;
                    outline: none;
                }

        b)get events of proected contetnt -

            use directive on projected content and get instance of that directive in component, using ContentChildern -
                @ContentChild(InputRefDirective) input: InputRefDirective;

    f)Multi-Slot Content Projection -

            <ng-content select="i"></ng-content>
            <ng-content select="input"></ng-content>

        but we could also look for an element with a given CSS class, and combine multiple selectors.

            <ng-content select="input.test-class"></ng-content>

        It's also possible to capture content that does not match any selector. For example, this would also inject the 
         input element into the template:

            <ng-content select="i"></ng-content>
            <ng-content></ng-content>


        In this context, the <ng-content></ng-content> tag without any selector would fetch all the content that did not 
            match any of the other selectors:
