Semantic HTML are as useful to screen readers as their aria role mappings.

    The <nav> element is mapped to a navigation role. So it is exposed as a navigation region to screen reader users.

    The <h2> element is mapped to a heading role, with the aria-level property set to the number in the elementâ€™s tag name, so the
        screen reader knows this is a level 2 heading.

    The <img> element is mapped to an img role, so users know that this is an image.

    The <button> is mapped to a button role, so users know it is a button. Since native HTML controls also come with functionality 
        baked in, the button also has attributes indicating that it is focusable, for example.

    All html elements are provided in accebility mapping doc but for day to day work "aria in html", provides more friendly mapping.
