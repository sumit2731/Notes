1)Firefox dev tools for flex box is best. shows the shrink and grow for a item.
2)By default each item occupies will have width, according to its content. so flexbox intrinsically sets width equal to -
    width: max-content

    now in max-content there are no line breaks. i.e very long lines also appears in single line.

    so at this point of point any flex-shrinking is not happening. but if you add random long string in second column(give it some line 
    so that content does not overflow container), then flex-shrink happens. so now some columns are shrink more than others, so how is
    width of item is determined in flexbox? answer is in snippet 3.
-----------Snippet 2------------------------------------------------

3)If content is too large to fit in container, then flex shrink kickcs in. however if flex shirnk if off then content will have 
width: max-content, and we will get overflow.
4)so first it determines content size, then it detremines if this will fit in container?
    if yes, then item have width accoriding to content.
    if no and flex shrink is off, then items will overflow.
    if no and flex shrink is on, then items will shrink to fit in contianer.
    
    but what decides how much each columns shrink?

---------------------------Snippet 3-----------------------------------------

5)when we give width or flex-basis to each item, now width of each item is not determined by max-content i.e it overwrites that 
    width:max-content behaviour, so it no longer looks at content size to determines the width, we have expliitly declared width,
    it will use that.

6) total width of content is 1200px, while parent is 600px, so flex-shrink comes into play.flex-shrink is rate at which items shrink by,
    as flex-shrink is equal for all columns, middle columns will always have more width then rest 2, because they all are going to  
    shrink by same rate)

7)but what determines the final size? here 600 is container size, 1200 is content size, as shrink rate is same for all, each column
    size is divided by 2. firefox dev tools shows us what was orignal size and how much item has shrunk. here it is nice round number,
    but this is not always the caase.

Trick to make equal width columns with flexbox uisng flex-shrink-
    1)set flex-basis of all items to 100%.
    2)flex-shrink should be 1    

Trick to make equal width columns with flexbox uisng flex-grow-


    1)set flex: 1 , on item, which means-
        flex-grow:1
        flex-shrink:1
        flex-basis: 0
-----------------Snippet5 - 
    1)problem with approaches explained in Snippet 4, because eof padding present in induival item.

------Snippet 6----------------------------------------------------------------

    solution of equal width columns. using flexbox. added a extra div item that is not having padding.soluion works for both
    flex-grow and flex-shrink.


----Snippet 7------------------------------------------------

    solution to problem in snippt 5 using grid.


flex-box vs grid - see video from last.


































flex-shrink is rate at which items shrink by. in example 3 middle item is still longer than last 2 items. because rate of
    shrink is same. so second item will alwas be larger.
