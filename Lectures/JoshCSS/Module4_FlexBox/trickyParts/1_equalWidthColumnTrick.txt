1)in lecture 3.2, we saw concept of flex:1 that makes equal size columns.
    this tricks sets the flex-basis to 0 , then because of flex-grow all columns ends up having equal width.

    but flex-basis cannot set the width lesser then minimum content,how does this works?

    See second video of exercise in 3.2

    answer to that is this min-width is given from flex-grow.

    consider case where are 2 columns and column1 has very large text and column2 has very small content.
    now even flex-basis is 0 but since flex-basis cannot set width/heigh smaller than minimum width, columns
    will have width according to its minimum content(this is taken from flex-grow). 
    
    so at very small widths width of column1 will be more than column2(if required we will have a scroll bar).
    since both of columns had flex-basis:0,these widths are because of flex-grow. but as flex-grow is same 
    and ratio should remain same, flexbox tries to do same. with further width increase of container.it keeps
    width of one item constant and given all width to other one until width because of flex-grow become equal.

    now as width of container increases second column2 width will keep on increasing and column1 width will 
    remain equal.this continues upto point when both columns have equal width, now ratios of width taken 
    because of flex-grow is same.now with further increase in width both columns get equal share hence 
    columns have equal width.


    Implications -
        That means width of columns will be equal when width of container is greater than 
        (max minColumnWidth of all columns) * number of columns.

    


2)to further support this statement consider case,when one column has flex-grow: 1 and other one has
    flex:1. see code in folder2
