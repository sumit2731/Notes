Imgae optimization -
    1)loading high-res variant and apply them automatically
    2)using next gen formats like webp and avif and gracefully falling back to jpg/png on unsupported browsers.
    3)they implement lazy loading.

1)srcset attributes -

    a)The Display Density Descriptor Method
        <img
            alt=""
            src="https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond.png"
            srcset="
                https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond.png 1x,
                https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@2x.png 2x,
                https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@3x.png 3x
            "
        />

    b)specifying image width -
        For image width, you use a w instead of an x.

        <img 
            srcset=" /wp-content/uploads/flamingo4x.jpg 4025w, 
                    /wp-content/uploads/flamingo3x.jpg 3019w,
                     /wp-content/uploads/flamingo2x.jpg 2013w, 
                     /wp-content/uploads/flamingo1x.jpg 1006w " 
            src="/wp-content/uploads/flamingo-fallback.jpg" 
        >

        It assumes that image width is equal to viewport and loads the image

    c)sizes attributes
        If you are using a srcset to specify width, the browser has to make some decisions about which image to download. 
        Unfortunately, it can’t figure that out until it knows the rendered size of the image — how large it will actually 
        appear on the screen.

        You can let the browser wait to figure this out (once it has parsed all the CSS), or you can give it enough information ahead
        of time so that it can start loading the correct image right away. This information can be provided with the width and height
        attributes.

        <img 
            
            srcset="/img/html/vangogh-sm.jpg 120w,
             /img/html/vangogh.jpg 193w,
             /img/html/vangogh-lg.jpg 278w"
            sizes="
                (max-width: 710px) 120px,
                (max-width: 991px) 193px,
                278px">

b)Using picture element(srcset and size attributes works exactly as they work on img) -
    a)we can spevify different file formats as well


        <picture>
            <source
                type="image/avif"
                srcset="
                    https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond.avif 1x,
                    https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@2x.avif 2x,
                    https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@3x.avif 3x
                "
            />
            <source
                type="image/webp"
                srcset="
                    https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond.webp 1x,
                    https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@2x.webp 2x,
                    https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@3x.webp 3x
                "
            />
            <img
                alt=""
            src="https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond.png"
            />
        </picture>

    b)adding media queries also

        <picture>
            <source 
                media="(min-width:600px) and (max-width:1200px)"
                srcset="images/sinai-medium-screen.jpg">
            <source media="(min-width:1201px)"
                srcset="images/sinai-large-screen.jpg">
            <img src="images/sinai-small-screen.jpg" alt="Unicorn Pool Float">
        </picture>


Extra from lecture -
    
    art direction problem(picture element) - The general problem whereby you want to serve different cropped images in that way, for
        various layouts,is commonly known as the art direction problem.

        use srcset attribute.
            For different screen resolutions (width size attribute)
            Fpr diffrent DPI

    resolution switching problem - Ideally, multiple resolutions would be made available to the user's web browser. The browser could
        then determine the optimal resolution to load based on the screen size of the user's device. This is called the resolution 
        switching problem.
