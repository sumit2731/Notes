Shebang line in executable scripts - 
    #!/usr/bin/env node

    in unix OS -

        shebang - determines which interpreter should be used for file execution on unix-like operating system.
        files in .bin folder have no extension,That's why a computer doesn't know how to execute those files.
        That's why this special Shiban line is used on Unix like systems to give instructions to your computer
        to how to launch certain file.

        You also noticed that each file in the folder is just plain text file, and to make it executable on Unix like 
        systems, we need to add this line at the very top.So this line must be the first line in executable file.

        what does this command do, it uses env executable to launch certain interpreter, in this cse - node. node must
        br in your path. so we launch node interpreter and inside node interpreter we execute the contents given executable
        file.
