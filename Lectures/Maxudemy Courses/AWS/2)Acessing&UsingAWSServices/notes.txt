17)Diffrent Ways of using AWS Services: CLI,SDK's & the AWS API.

    see slide 32

    Management Console
    AWS CLI -
        you need to install CLI and configure it.once you also know how to use it,which does take some practice and which
         is a bit more advanced, it's perfect for executing well known, possibly repeated tasks, and it can simplify complex
          or repeated large-scale setups, becuase now you dnt have to click through various pages of some web UI.
        
        Instead, you can run exactly the commands you want,and you can even automate them with custom-made scripts or 
        anything like that.
    SDk's - Now here we're talking about writing code in various programming languages that in the end, then also sends 
        commands to AWS behind the scenes to use certain AWS services in a certain way.you can basically manage your AWS 
        infrastructure,so the services you want to use and the way you want to use them as code.

        This is what infrastrycture as a code mean.

        You can write a script in Python, for example,which will start a server, install some software on it,
         then start a process, and then shut down the server once it's done, and all you need to do then is run that 
         script instead of performing all these steps manually.
