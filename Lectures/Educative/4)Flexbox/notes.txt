case 1 - 
    container -no width, 
    item - no width
    
    items will have width which is enough to accomodate contents in item,even if there hass to be scroll bar.
    but width of container will be only equal to widnow width without scroll bar. so ite wil overflow.
    
    if there is some text in flex-items it will go to next line to decrease the width. but in case of continues text it needs
    to be in single line only.
    

case 2 - 
    container - no width ,
    item - width

    case 1 - if after giving mentiond width to flex-item all flex-item all still in container, then mentioned width will given.

    case 2 - giving mentioned width causes overflow -
    
        case 2.1 - (width of flex-item) > (width of content of flex-item)
            width of flex item will adust so that there is no scroll in flex item i.e all items adjust under same container. but
             min width will be equal to width of content.

        Case 2.2 - (width of flex-item) < (width of content of flex-item)
            In this case flex-item will have width given to it, not more than that. diffrent flex items will have diffrent 
            width depeding upon there content.but mn width is decided by content.there may be scroll bar.

case 3 - container has width, item has width, but item also has text, which is less than item width.
    In this case item will have min-width to display text, even if it means scroll.
