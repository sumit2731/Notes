    use to align text, if there is empty spce in container.text-align is also capable of aligning other elements, like images.
    In general, though, we'll use other tools for those kinds of jobs. We should reserve text-align for text.

7)letter-spacing
    We can tweak the horizontal gap between characters using the letter-spacing property.

8)line-height
    values - 1,2,3
        We can tweak the vertical distance between lines using the line-height property.
        
        line-height is a bit of an odd duck because it takes a unitless number. This number is multiplied by the element's font-size
        to calculate the actual line height.

        By default, browsers come with a surprisingly small amount of line height. In Chrome, the default value is 1.15. In Firefox,
        it's 1.2. according to WCAG 1.4.12, it's value should be 1.5.It's possible to pass other unit types (eg. pixels, rems), but I
        recommend always using this unitless number, so that the line-height always scales with the element's font-size.
