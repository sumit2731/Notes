        DOMContentLoaded - 
            HTML is fully downloaded and parsed(we know everything in it), DOM tree is fully built
            all script tags with defer attribute are executed
            Before stylesheets, images, and other non-critical resources are fully loaded.
            It is useful for setting up event listeners, modifying the DOM, or initializing features that do not depend on external resources.

            you can listen to this event on window and document.
        load -
            HTML and all known resources have been downloaded and rendered.
            this waits for all external resources (e.g., images, CSS) to load,except those that are lazy loaded.
            notice world known - with js we can add mor images dynamically, here we mean only those images which is in html, we can img with js
                anytime if they are added before load event, then load event will wait for them to be rendered.


Events -
    DOM is loaded and parsed
    domInteractive
        HTML is loaded,parsed and the DOM is built
        CSS and images at this point are still to be parsed and loaded
    deferScriptsExecuted
