now we will work on navigation bar. see figure 6. we will make these 3 navigation bars. now most of times
    navigation bar is designed like this -
            
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#"></a></li>
                    <li><a href=""></a></li>
                    <li><a href=""></a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>

    now a days, we dnt use ulwe just put bunch of a links in nav. in this course we will use ul approach because
        it is lot more common.

Also in code we are using compund selectors, but generally we should go with class approach. here kevin just wants
 to show ompund selectirs, that s why he is using them. aalso another thing is we should keep our compund selectors
 simple. for ex, here we are uisng -
     nav a {}
      some tutorials use this-

    nav ul li a {}

    there is no need to complicate it. it is dificult to read and it increases the specificity.

In Code -

    here we used flexbox appraoch. first we convert ul into flexbox. then we center things using justify-content.
    one approch as that we give some width to ul(may be hardcoded or in percentage). but if we have to add new items,
    we ave ot increase the approch, but here flexbox handles it automatically.
