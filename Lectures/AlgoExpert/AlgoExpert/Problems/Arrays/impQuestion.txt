1)medium -> 
    3(to arrange all instance of number at the end of array)
    4-(monolithicArray)is monotonic(wrote program but output was wrong, missed use case when initial numbers are same)
    5- (spiral) - I solved but it took lot of time, course solution was much simpler. but my appraoch as right
    6- longestPeak - solved with similar complecity but course solution ws very simple and scalable.
    7 - top able to solve with O(1) complexity
    8 - merge overlappingArray - able to solve  y debugging the code.
