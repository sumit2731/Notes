1)npm install react-router-dom@5

2)Steps to activate react router - 

    index.js -

        ReactDOM.render(
            <BrowserRouter>
                <App />
            </BrowserRouter>, 
            document.getElementById('root')
        );

    app.js -

        return (
            
            <main>
                
                <Route path ="/welcome">
                    <Welcome></Welcome>
                </Route>

                <Route path="/products">
                    <Products></Products>
                </Route>
                
                <Route path="/products/:productId">
                    <ProductDetail></ProductDetail>
                </Route>
            
            </main>
      
         );

    Matching in react router world means your path starts with the path defined here. so if we are at products/p1, then this
    path starts with /products, which is second route so it will be rendered. 3rd path is also matched it will also be rendered.

    so more that one Route will be rendered. to alter that behvaiour use switch component from react-router-dom. wrap your Route 
    components inside switch, now only one Route,which ever is match(it matches start of path not entire path) first will be rendered.
    this is behaviour of version 5. so second route will rendered even if 3rd one is more specififc.

    there is a param called, exact if we add it, then Route will be rendered if it is exat match of url.
    
    

2)navigate to routes -

     <Link to="/welcome">Welcome</Link>

3)attachng classes to active link -

     <NavLink to="/welcome" activeClassName = {classes.active}>Welcome</NavLink>

4)dynamic route -

        <Route path="/product-detail/:productId">
          <ProductDetail></ProductDetail>
        </Route>

5)extracting route params -

    import {useParams} from 'react-router-dom';

    const ProductDetail = () => {
        const params = useParams();
        console.log(params.productId);
    };

6)nesting routes -
    we can add Route component at multiple levels. Route component in component will be evlauted if that component is active.
    in code our route is added in app.js -

                  <Route path="/welcome">
                    <Welcome></Welcome>
                  </Route>

    we we go to welcome/new-user, we load welcome component. within welcome component we have this route -
            <Route path="/welcome/new-user">
                <p>Welcome, New User</p>
            </Route>

    since welcome component is active so this route wll be considered , since path matches, so p tag will be displayed.

7)redirect -

        <Route path="/" exact>
            <Redirect to="/welcome"></Redirect>
        </Route>
