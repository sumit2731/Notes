/**
 * React state is used to track data that changes over time. In this case, hasAgreed can flip 
 *  between true/false as the user toggles the checkbox.By default, state is only made available
 *  to the current component. Our Button.js component isn't privy to the hasAgreed state variable.
 *  State isn't global.

    Props allow us to funnel data from one component to another. You can think of it as an interstate 
    highway system for our data, or like a network of tunnels that data can flow through.
    
    We can pass static values (strings, numbers, boolean values) through props, or we can pass 
    dynamic state variables. It doesn't matter to React.
