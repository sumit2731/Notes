Video1 - It is everything that I already new.

    justify-content -
        flex-start
        flex-end
        center
        space-between
        space-around
        space-evenly(not avalible in IE)


    align-items -
        flex-start
        flex-end
        center
        stretch
        baseline

Video 3 - centering a flex-items. trick here was that container needs to have some height.we saw why setting 100vh solution,
    is not good for mobile.

one thing - only items of main container are put into the flex layout mode. their childern of children are not in flexbox layout,
    it means flexbox does that have recursive effect.
