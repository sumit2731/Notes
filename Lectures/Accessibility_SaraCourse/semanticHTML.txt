    header
    nav
    main
    footer - small (copyright info or disacliamers)
        You use <footer> at the bottom of a page. It usually includes contact information, copyright information, and some site 
        navigation
    aside - An aside element defines content that’s less important. It’s often used for sidebars—areas that add complementary but
        nonessential information.

    article - The article tag defines content that could stand independently of the page or site it’s on. It does not necessarily 
        mean a “blog post.” Think of it more as “an article of clothing”—a self-contained item that can be used in various 
        contexts.
    section - Using <section> is a way of grouping nearby content of a similar theme. A section tag differs from an article tag. 
        It isn’t necessarily self-contained, but it forms part of something else.
