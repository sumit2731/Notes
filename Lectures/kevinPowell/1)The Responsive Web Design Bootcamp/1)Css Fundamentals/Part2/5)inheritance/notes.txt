Inheritance is very concepts in css and it almost exclusively applies to text properties. you can make any thing inherit,
there is a way but by defaut most text proeprties are inherited.

as we said most type related properties are inherited, so it saves us lot of code. so we set font-family on body an it
flows through entire document. same thing is for color.

There are some times where things are little weird, like our links are'nt inheriting certain proeprties. you must be 
wondering they are just text. so why dont they. somethig intersting happens with heading also, we will see them.

so inheritance has lowest specificity.if secton has some color, then p in that scetion will inherit but if in p
tag selector, we some other selector it will override it. most browser has some default color of a tag and it 
overrides the inherited color. they inherit other proeptie slike font size and font weight.

otherthing is h tags dnt inherit font-weight that is because tey are bold by default. i.e there is browser default
style applied on them.

we can give value of inherit to any css property then that value will be inhrited from parent. like-

a {
    color: inherit;
}

y this way we can make any property in css to take inherited value.
