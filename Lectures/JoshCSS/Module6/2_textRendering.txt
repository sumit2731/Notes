Text Rasterization
    "bitmap font"

    It's much more common for fonts to use vector formats like ttf, otf, svg, and woff/woff2. In a vector font, we store 
        a mathematical set of instructions for each character.

    In order to turn a vector font into characters on a screen, though, the browser has to figure out which color to 
        make each pixel, a process known as rasterization.

    As you might imagine, this method of rasterization produces sharp, pixellated text:

    To make the text appear smoother, the browser can apply "anti-aliasing"
