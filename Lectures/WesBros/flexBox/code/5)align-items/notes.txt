align-items adjusts the items along cross axis when there is single row. twhen there are mutiple rows, use align content property.
    default value is strtech. In code we used baseline, which is very handy. it allows o align items so that baseline is same.


    Figure 1- items are of diffrenert size, but text is on same line.(align-items: baseline)
    Figure 2 - height of items is diffrent but each item is in center, of conrtainer.(align-items: center)
    Figure 3- Here main axis is top to bottom, align-item:center. so each item is in horizontal center, depending on its size.
