here we looked at height of flexitems. with display:flex, size of element was dependent on content in them.but all flex-items have
    same height. this what we wanted form long time, but now it is so easy with flex-box. if we give height to one of flex-items
    it takes that height, but other ones have height i.e equal to height of content box  of flexConatiner. this is happening
    because of align-items:strtch.


In second part of video we saw that we height greater than longest flex-items to one of items, height of container increases and 
    other items also strech to fill out whole container.

here our container is not having any explicit height set on it. it all depends upon height of flex-items, which in turn depends
    on it's content.

My Observation -

if our container has a height set on it, all flex-item stretch to fill the height. if we give explicit height to one of items,
    1)if that height is less than height of container then that items shriks, other items continue to occupiy full height.
    2)if height is more than height of container, then that item moves out of container, but rest items remains inside container
