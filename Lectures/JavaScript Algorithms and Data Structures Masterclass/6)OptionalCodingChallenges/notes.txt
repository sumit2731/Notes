    Udemy Course Problems -

        1)problem 1 of udemy couurse(and sliding pattern problem of previous section), educative solution is less confusining 
            and less chances of errors are there.idea is to use another loop for shrinking window so that no of usecase reduce 
            in outer loop. 

    educative Problems -

        All educative problems use outer loop to increase the window and inner loop to decrease the window. problem 1.
         when size of window needs to remain fix, then both of these loops run togather - problem 2,3

        2)Falied to answer educative problem 2, even took lot of time to understand after solution.
        3)In problem 2,3 we increase and decrease size of window at same time.
        4)
 
        2)educative problem - better solution in course for educarive problem 3.(permutationsINString)
        3)educative problem 4 - solved but took lot of time. but appraoch 2 is better, so use approach 2 is using inner loop,
            itn can be used in other problems also.

        4)educative problem 5 -I solved the problem but course solution was good.

Attempt 3 -

    solved all problems of course.
