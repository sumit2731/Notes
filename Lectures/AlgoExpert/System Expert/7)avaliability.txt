Nines - 2 nienes,  3 nines.

SLA - Service level agreement. it is agreement that state that susytem will be avaible for how much tim.
SLO - service level objecttive. it is componenet of SLA.

You dnt always need to have high avalibility.it might come at cost of high latetcy and low throughput.we can also decide which
parts of our system need high avalibility.


how to increase the avalibility of system? anawer is eliminate single points of failure. this is done by redundancy. redundancy is
    duplicating or multiplying the parts of your system.

    Passive Redundancy - having multiple load balancers and multiple servers. it is when you have multiple components at given layer in your
        system and at any point if one of those components for instnce one of these servers dies noting is gonna happen. other servers will
        constinue to run smoothly.

    Active redundancy - whne you have multiple machines that work togather in such a way that only one or few of the machines are gonna be 
    typically handling traffic or doing work. if one of these machines fails, other mmachine will know that machine has failed and they gonna
    take over.
