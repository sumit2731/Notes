Problems with ESM -

    1)ESM for nodes is not there yet.mjs is in process.js
    2)in browser, they are are very very slow.they are unuseable past 10 modules.reason is this is done all at run time.
        so using ESM in browser is not a option, it is very slow, even if you are using 1 module.

    3)Diffreet libraries can use diffrent module formtat.
