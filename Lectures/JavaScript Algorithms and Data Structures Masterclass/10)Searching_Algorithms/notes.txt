Linear Search -

    Linear search means going through elements one by one and look for match. we can start from start or end.

        In js,we have below methods for linear Search-

            1)indexOf
            2)includes
            3)find
            4)findIndex

        Big O of Linear Search -
            best - O(1)
            worst - O(n)
            average - O(n)
                
        it is not a bad approach but
        if we have sorted array then there are better approachs.

Binary Search -
    1)It eiminates half of remaining elements at a time
    2)It works on sorted array.

    Time Compelxity of binary search -
    best acse - O(1)
    Worst &Average Case - O(logn)

    Log n mans it is very fast. it is very close to O(1)
