/**
 * React doesn't care what type our state is. We can store numbers or strings or arrays or objects.
 * We can even store functions in state if we want!*

    But there's a catch: React state changes have to be immutable. When we call setColors, we need 
    to provide a brand new array. We should never mutate arrays or objects held in state.
