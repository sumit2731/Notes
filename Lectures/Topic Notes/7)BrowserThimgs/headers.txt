response headers -
    content-type - The Content-Type representation header is used to indicate the original media type of the resource (prior to
        any content encoding applied for sending).

        In responses, a Content-Type header provides the client with the actual content type of the returned content. This 
        header's value may be ignored, for example when browsers perform MIME sniffing; set the X-Content-Type-Options header
        value to nosniff to prevent this behavior.

    Content-Language - Accept- Language
    
    cookie -

        Set-Cookie

    CORS-


        Access-Control-Allow-Origin - That header should contain the allowed origin (in our case https://javascript.info), or a 
            star *. Then the response is successful, otherwise it’s an error.

        
        Safe response headers that can be accessed in response of safe request -


            Cache-Control
            Content-Language
            Content-Type: 'application./json'
            Expires
            Last-Modified
            Pragma

        Access-Control-Expose-Headers - sent by server in safe request,it contains a comma-separated list of unsafe header names 
            that should be made accessible.
        
        Access-Control-Allow-Methods  - must have the allowed method.
        
        Access-Control-Allow-Headers - must have a list of allowed headers.

        Access-Control-Max-Age(optional) - specify a number of seconds to cache the permissions. So the browser won’t 
         have to send a preflight for subsequent requests that satisfy given permissions.


        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials - allows client to set cookies and auth informtaion in CORS request.



    security -
        Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) - The HTTP Strict Transport Security header informs the browser that it 
            should never load a site using HTTP and should automatically convert all attempts to access the site using
            HTTP to HTTPS requests instead.
            
            syntax -

                Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>
                Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; includeSubDomains
                Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; preload

                Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains

        Content-Security-Policy (CST) - you can enable it by adding header or by using meta tag -

            <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
                content="default-src 'self'; img-src https://*; child-src 'none';">


            what it does -
                a)A CSP compatible browser will then only execute scripts loaded in source files received from those 
                    allowed domains, ignoring all other scripts (including inline scripts and event-handling HTML 
                    attributes).

                b)he server can specify which protocols are allowed to be used; for example (and ideally, from a security
                 standpoint), a server can specify that all content must be loaded using HTTPS.

                    cookies attributes - marking all cookies with the secure attribute and providing automatic redirects
                     from HTTP pages to their HTTPS counterparts.
        
        X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header-This is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types 
            advertised in the Content-Type headers should be followed and not be changed. The header allows you to avoid MIME
            type sniffing by saying that the MIME types are deliberately configured.

        X-Frame-Options - The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be 
            allowed to render a page in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed> or <object>. Sites can use this to avoid click-jacking attacks,
            by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites. 

request headers -
    accept: text/html - The Accept request HTTP header indicates which content types, expressed as MIME types, the client is 
        able to understand. The server uses content negotiation to select one of the proposals and informs the client of the 
        choice with the Content-Type response header.Browsers set required values for this header based on the context of the
        request. For example, a browser uses different values in a request when fetching a CSS stylesheet, image, video, or a
        script.

        example -
            Accept: text/html

            Accept: image/*

            // General default
            Accept: */*

            // Default for navigation requests
            Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, application/xml;q=0.9, */*;q=0.8
    Accept-Language -This request HTTP header indicates the natural language and locale that the client prefers. The server uses
        content negotiation to select one of the proposals and informs the client of the choice with the Content-Language 
        response header. Browsers set required values for this header according to their active user interface language. Users
        rarely change it, and such changes are not recommended because they may lead to fingerprinting.

        Accept-Language: fr-CH, fr;q=0.9, en;q=0.8, de;q=0.7, *;q=0.5
    
    origin - tells from where the request came. (such as https://javascript.info)
    content-type - application/json - what we are sending to the server.
    
    CORS-
        

        headers allowed in safe request -

            Accept,
            Accept-Language,
            Content-Language,
            Content-Type with the value application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data or text/plain.
        
        Access-Control-Request-Methods - header has the method of the unsafe request.
        Access-Control-Request-Headers - header provides a comma-separated list of its unsafe HTTP-headers.

    Referer - The Referer HTTP request header contains an absolute or partial address of the page that makes the 
            request.can be controlled by response header - Referrer Policy


    Referrer-Policy - The Referrer-Policy HTTP header controls how much referrer information (sent with the Referer header) should
        be included with requests. Aside from the HTTP header, you can set this policy in HTML.
