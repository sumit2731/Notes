Latency - How long it takes data to transverse a system i.e how long it takes for data to travl from one place to another in system.
    diffrent things in system hav diffrent latency.

    Some exmaples of latenccies of diffrent tyoes of data transfers(just remeber comparison) -

        1)read 1mb of sequentally data from memory - 250 micro seconds
        2)1mb from ssd - 1000 micro seconds
        3)sending 1 mb data over 1gbps network(not takin into consideartion physical distnace) - 10,000 microsconds
        4)1 mb from HDD - 20,000 micro secods
        5)sending a pcket (1000 to 1500 bytes) from CA -> netherlands -> CA - 150,000 microseconds


    while designing a system, we need to lower the overall latency of system.

Throughput - It is how much amount of work machine can perform in a given period of time. we are really refering to how much data can be
    transferred from one point in a system to another point in a system in a given amount of time. we measure throughput in gigabits/second
    or kilobits per seconds.when we say we have network of 1gbps it means thsi network can support one gigbyte per second.

    lets say we have a server and multiple clients, throuput is how much request client can handle in given amount of time.or ifwe can
    convert request t bits, how many bits can server handle or let through.


these 2 are importnt paramters of measuring the performace of system.but they are not corelated, you might have one system which has very
    low latency and low throughput. so time saved in low latemcy is actually lost out becase of low throughput.
