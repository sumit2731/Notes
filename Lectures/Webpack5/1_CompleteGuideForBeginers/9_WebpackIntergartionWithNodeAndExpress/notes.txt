code1 -
    here we served prod build of single page application with express server. chnages -
        a)server .js returns index.html
        b)but since index.html had relative paths for seets , wassets were not getting loaded.
        c) served the assets through a route in express.
        d)but now all assets should be called with fetched with that route, for this used pubLicAssetPath in webpack config.


code 2 - same as 1 so not done
