Every java project will have src folder which contains your code in package format.

In notepad -
    creating java program -
        vi HelloWorld.java
        write prgram
        in the end do - :wq
    javac helloWorld.java (generates the complied machine code in same folder - helloWorld.class)
    java  helloWorld (here jvm  runs the helloWorld.class generated in first step)

    These 2 steps can be combined into single one(in newer version of java)  -

    java helloWorld.java
