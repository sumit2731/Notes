4 rounds - 2 days.

Round 1 -
    General UI concepts.
        Application - Small Email Client. 
            Folders like inbox, sent etc.on clicking on folder emails in that folder opened. then clicking on induival email
                opened up email.you can come up with your own design.you can assume emails to be in json if you want to.
        main focus on -
            use of vanilla js
            how well i can manage things
            how good i can write code
            Am being modular?
        Few feature that were asked to developed mainly focused on -
            persisting the state of application
            Making the dynamic behaviour -
                suppose If a new mail comes, i.e new mail is added to json, how your UI should 
                    render, 
                how dynamically everything should be modularized. 
                each mail can be read or unread

        Main ourpose was checking whether i can properly use local storage, what should i use, what i am using too maintain
        the state and what I am using to write the code.

        time given one hour. he did it in 15 minutes. rest time was to apply some css and all.

Round 2 -
    Mainly focussed on DS.Problem was like this -
        youhave menu of ecommerce website, which can nested at any level.It has catalog of products. how will you search a product.
