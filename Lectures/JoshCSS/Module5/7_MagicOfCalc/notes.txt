For almost a decade now, CSS has had the ability to do math - 

    .something {
        width: calc(100px + 24px);
        height: calc(50px + 25px * 4);
    }

operators that can be used -

    a)addition(+)
    b)subtraction(-)
    c)multiplication(*)
    d)division(/)


Why would we want to do this?


    a)which of these two declarations make it clearer that you want .something to take up 1/7th of the available space?

        .something {
            width: 14.286%;
            width: calc(100% / 7);
        }

    b)The real magic of calc, though, is that it allows us to mix units:
        
        .something {
            width: calc(50% + 32px);
        }

The more-practical benefit of calc comes when we combine it with CSS variables.

    article {
        padding: var(--spacing);
        border-radius: calc(var(--spacing) / 2);
        /*
            8px -> 4px
            16px -> 8px
        */
        border-radius: calc(var(--spacing) / 2 + 2px);
    }

Unit conversion

    h2 {
        /* 24 / 16 = 1.5 */
        font-size: 1.5rem;
        font-size: calc(24 / 16 * 1rem);
    }
    The very first number, 24, is our value in pixels. We can use this pattern anywhere we want to be responsible and use the rem 
        unit, without having to change our mental model.


Calculating colors and gradients

    Calculating colors -

        :root {
            --red-hue: 0deg;
            --intense: 100% 50%;
    
            --red: hsl(
                var(--red-hue) var(--intense)
            );
            
            --orange: hsl(
                calc(var(--red-hue) + 20deg)
                var(--intense)
            );
        }

Exercise -
    Problem - This was just to play around with css custom properties and calc function.
    Solution - 
        a)Here we provided different index value to custom css property on different boxes.we did that using nth-of-type()
            selector
        b)then in common class we used this value to geneate different angle and colors for gradient.
        c)then we used this property to provide animation times to give different time to animation.
