1)CollectionOverview
    Figure 1
        List - items are stored in order
        Set - no duplicates
        map - key value pairs

    What to learn? which collection to use in which case.(better performance in terms of time and space).
    It is not library, its framework.It is not bunch of classes that you use ,It is also guideline to 
    implement your own collections.
