by default(if we do not have webpack-config file) entry point for webpack is index.js. lets run webpack command.

we will get strange error, but error is about it is not able to find index.js file in .src folder. why we get
error it is some node thing, check lecture for same. lets crete a index.js file in src folder. write a simple alert
statement in it. now again run webpack command.

lets create a emprty file called index.js in source folder. if we run npm satrt, now it saying
something about main.js. it built our code into main.js. then there is a warning that we did not set
the mode option, by default it used prod mode.

you can see there is file in dist fodler called main.js, it file spitted out by webapck, but we wrote a simple statement
and webpack didi some magic, this statement is nested around (), {} etc.
