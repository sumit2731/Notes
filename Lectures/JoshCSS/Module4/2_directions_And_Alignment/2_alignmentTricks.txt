align-items:baseline.
    this can be used to algn a logo of company to navbar.
    THis even works with html elements like input and button


    Safari bug when there is no text in input box. workarounds -
        a)use placeholder
        b)If design does not allow for placeholder, then use empty placeholder.
        c)align-items:center will do the trick if label and inputsize are of same length.it's good to keep the sizing 
            consistent anyway. Use font-weight or color to add contrast between them, if desired.

exercise 1 -
    Here we had 3 items. Bigger item we want to place at center and rest 2 we want to center by baseline.

    Approach1 - use lineheight equal to container, bigger item will be centered. in felx, box use baseline alignment.
    Apparoach 2(right one) - use nested flex box. outer flexbox centers container. container height is eqal to bigger text.
        so now bigger item is centered, in inner flexbox use align-items:center.
    
    mathematical centering vs optical centering(in line more space is left at top than bottom)

align-self proeprty

why justify-self does not exist -
    We can solve for primary-axis positioning using other properties we'll discover, like flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, 
        and order. These properties offer much more flexibility than justify-self would. also we have margin trick.
