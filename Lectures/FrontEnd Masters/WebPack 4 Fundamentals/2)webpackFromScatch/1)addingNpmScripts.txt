1)npm adds executables for all packages in bin folder in node_modules. npm allows you to run scripts that hoist that binary 
    package within its scope.

2)webpak defauts -
    entry - src/index.js (only src is provided it will look for index.ts also)

3)how to use exiting command in npm -
    
    "scripts": {
        "webpack": "webpack",
        "dev": "npm run webpack 
    }

4)how to pass paramteres to while reusing existng command -
    "scripts": {
        "webpack": "webpack",
        "dev": "npm run webpack -- --mode development" 
    }

    -- says pipe in the next arguments to orignal commnads.

5)how to debug a node file in chrome -

    1)node inspect ./code1/app.js
        1)Breakpoint breaks on first line. in cmd shows the line on which breakpoint stops.
        2)To Integrate with vscode -
            a)Attach with vs code using "toggle auto attach".vs code breakpoints will work now.


    2)node --inspect ./index.js -
        If no breakpoint is placed then file will be executed.
        can debug in chrome, as well as vs code


    3)node --inspect --inspect-brk ./index.js
        
        a)In chrome open - chrome://inspect/#devices
        b)Remote Target- click on "inspect"
        c) breakpoint will open in chrome debugger.
        d)If you want to attach in vscode -
            Attach with vs code using "toggle auto attach".vs code breakpoints will work now.

6)then to debug webpack add this script-

    "debug": "node --inspect --inspect-brk ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js",















2)how to used both ESM and common js module sytax in same file.
    then we saw that we cannot use both syntax's in same file.

    see this link - https://pencilflip.medium.com/using-es-modules-with-commonjs-modules-with-webpack-2cb6821a8b99

3)aways move your exports at bottom of file.

4)alsways use ESM modules syntax. webpack leverages that to just pull what you need and it can do other optimizations.
    we saw a example of dead code elimination by using ESM modules for export.

5)all code is in feature/031-all-modules-types

6)see geneate bundle in kode none.
