display:none 
    Element is effectively removed from the DOM.
    other elements take it's position.
    cannot be clicked or focused

visibility:hidden
    The visibility property allows you to hide an element, but in a slightly different way. It's like a cloak of invisibility;
    the item can't be seen, but it's still there, taking up space.
    It can be selectively undone by children.

opacity -
    An item needs to be semi-visible
    An item's visibility needs to be animated, fading in and out

    Hiding from visusal Users -
    
        display: none or visibility: hidden? In fact, these properties are too effective; they hide the contents from screen-reader
        users as well!
    
        some times we want to hide text from visual user but make it avalible for normal users. above 3 methods also hides them screen reader.
        this is css do to same -

            .visually-hidden {
                position: absolute;
                overflow: hidden;
                clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
                height: 1px;
                width: 1px;
                margin: -1px;
                padding: 0;
                border: 0;
            }

    Hiding from screen readers -
        aria-hidden="true"
