Minicube - sets the dummy cluster locally.it will use a virtual machine oon your machine, to create the cluster in there.So it simulates
    another machine on your machine by using such a virtual machine and the this virtual machine 
    then holds this cluster.It will actually create a single node cluster which means there the worker and master node
    is combined into one single virtual machine
