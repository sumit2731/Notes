Before  Webpack -
    multiple files in index.html. Order determines which files should be loaded first. changing order breaks app.
    Grunt Gulp - These tools helped us to manage assets and concatenate all our JavaScript files into one.
        But they still cannot figure out dependencies between those files.
    require.js - In order to manage JavaScript dependencies we used required JS which helps in the way, but it's not
        as powerful as Webpack.

Webpack is static module bundler.

install webpack -
    npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

1)Here we saw that we can run webpack without any initial confguration - 
    npx webpack

    By default it makes some assumptions about entryFile and where it places final build -
        entry file - src/index.js
        bundle is generated at - dist/main.js

    
2)Then we used this command to get details -

    npx webpack --stats detailed
3)Then we create a config file for webpack- webpackConfig.js. and added a command in npm scripts.
    "build": webpack
