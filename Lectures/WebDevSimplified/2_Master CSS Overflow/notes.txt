overflow (deals with content overflowing in entire container)
    visible - default value.content overflows the container. 
    hidden - hides the content when it crosses border of container, borders are ignored.
    scroll - always displays the scrollbar even if content fits inside container
    auto - displays scrollbar only if content does not fit.
    clip - need to specify this for both x and y axis. similar to hidden but you can use another proeprty
        overflow-clip-margin along with this to control how content overflows.
        values for overflow-clip-margin -
            border-box
            padding-box
            content-box
            10px (useful in cases where you want your content to overflow a little)
            -10px

    known bug -
        you need to specify this property for both x and y axis.
    relatively new property not supported in all browsers


    overflow-anchor -
        auto - when new content is added, scroll position does not move.
        none - when new content is added , scroll position is adjusted


word-break - deals with long word that overflows the container -
    1)word-wrap(browsers implemented this because ppl started using it) or overflow-wrap (use this). it controls
        how a world wraps around new line if it overflows the container.
            a)normal - default, content will overflow the container
            b)break-word - It breaks the word and it wraps on new line.d/w between this word-break:break-all is
                that it takes the word that is to be broken to new line. however if we use hyphen: auto, then
                word is not moved to new line but hyphen is added.
            c)anywhere(not used that much) - same as breakword, but difference is how it works with min-width. 
                container -
                    width: min-width;
                    max-width: 200px
                with anywhere width of container wil depend upon some other longest word and span with this property
                    will be broken to nw line. however with breakword, span will be tried to fit in box util it reaches
                    max-width, then it will be wrapped.

    2)word-break - deals with how word breaks when it overflows the container.
        normal - does not break word, they stay exactly where they are.
        break-all - breaks the word and moves it to new line. 
            dw between word-break: break-all and overflow-wrap:break-word -
                overflow-wrap:break-word - moves word to next line
                word-break:break-all - does not move word to next line 

            It will not break chinese, japnese and korean symbols unless it is specific section where it is supposed to
            break those apart. this is because of way these languages are written, if you take 2 symbols and break them
            apart, it will complelty change the meaning of word or sentence.breaking these changes the meaning
                of word.
        keep-all - his only matters if you use one of above languages and it will prevent any breaks from happening
            inside the word. if you are not using these languages then this works in same way normal(which is default).
        break-word - Do not use it. it is same as setting overflow-wrap to anywhere and leaving
            break-word to normal, so they discontinued this property


what happens when words do overflow the container, what can you do to notify the user that things are overflowing
    to make it easier for them to understand what's going on.

    1)hyphen -
        auto - when used with overflow-wrap: break-word or overflow-wrap: anywhere, it does not move word to new
            line, instead it adds hyphens to word to be broken.it does not add hyphen when we use word-break,
        manual - it only shows hyphen, if it is mentioned in html. also hyphen is showed at same place where it
            is mentioned in html.

        none -

    2)text-overflow -
        clip - clips any text that is overflowing.
        ellipses - shows eliipsis to user. this only works if -
            a)
                we have exactly one line of text.In order to have single line of text use -
                    white-space: nowrap

                or

                we limit the number of rows using -
                    display:            -webkit-box;
                    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
                    -webkit-line-clamp: 2 
            
            b)overflow content is hidden -
                overflow: hidden
