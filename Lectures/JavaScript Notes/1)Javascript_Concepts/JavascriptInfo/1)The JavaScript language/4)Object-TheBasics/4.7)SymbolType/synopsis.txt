1)how to create symbol - description, symbols are always unique.
2)symbols do not auto convert to string. we have to call toString method on it explicitly.
3)symbols are used to create hidden properties on object used by another script.
4)symbols do not appear in for..in and Object.keys() loops, In contrast, Object.assign copies both string and symbol properties.
5)global symbol registry(Global) - We can create symbols in it and access them later, and it guarantees that repeated accesses by the 
    same name return exactly the same symbol.

    In order to read (create if absent) a symbol from the registry, use Symbol.for(key).

    That call checks the global registry, and if there’s a symbol described as key, then returns it, otherwise creates a new 
        symbol Symbol(key) and stores it in the registry by the given key.

    Symbols inside the registry are called global symbols. If we want an application-wide symbol, accessible everywhere in the 
        code – that’s what they are for.

    Symbol.keyFor

6)There exist many “system” symbols that JavaScript uses internally, and we can use them to fine-tune various aspects of our 
    objects.
