1)Single Responisbility Principal - (SRP)

    Example - Fetching and Showing Form

2)Open/Closed Principal (OCP) - The OCP states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

    In ReactJS, this means that components should be designed in such a way that they can be extended with new functionality, but 
        the original code does not have to be modified. This is achieved by making use of inheritance and composition.

    Example - Genral Form and Specific Form

3)Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) -
    The LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass.

4)Interface Segregation Principal(ISP) - The ISP states that a class ( or a function ) should not be forced to implement interfaces
    it does not use. 

    Ex- 
        Notification Component - Email, SMS,Push Notification
        Medicine Component - Main Component and Side Props


5) Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

    The DIP states that high-level modules ( classes of functions ) should not depend on low-level modules ( tools ) , but both 
    should depend on abstractions ( the way that allowd hight level modules to use or connect the low level modules ).

    to explain more, do not do the fetching and showing the data at the same place, and make it all one block , instead separate 
    the fetching and make it as a tool could be used by another components ( when just replace the source or the URL) .
