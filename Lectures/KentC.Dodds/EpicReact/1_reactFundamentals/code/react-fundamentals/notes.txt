DEfault Behavviour -
    Browser leavs parsing of html, downloads the script and executes it. After that it continues with parsing.


defer attribute -
    Downloads the script in parallel with html parsing, executes it when DOM is ready.But before DOMContentLoaded Event.

    
    
    In Non module - 
        a)The defer attribute is ignored if the <script> tag has no src.
    In Module - 
        a)All modules scripts re defer by default.both inline and external

async attribute -
    In other words, async scripts load in the background and run when ready.
    
    In Non Module -
        a)Works only on external scripts
    Module -
        a)Works on inline and external scripts.

    Dynamic Scripts -
        BY default Dynamic scripts are async
        
        This can be changed if we explicitly set script.async=false. Then scripts will be executed in the document order, just like defer.
