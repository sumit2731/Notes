a)img srcset attribute -
    Download different images based on different viewport width -
        In srcset we mention imageUrl followed by actual size of image. we use but 1600w instead of
            1600px because this number means how actual wide our image is in actual intrinsic pixels.
            we do not define it with css pixels, because sometimes your screen has more amount of pixels than css
            pixels (when you are zoomed in and your device has pixel density)
        <img
            src="tree-1200.jpg"
            alt="A tree"
            srcset="tree-400.jpg 400w, tree-800.jpg 800w, tree-1200.jpg 1200w"
        />

        Browser is going to have a look at actual resolution of your screen as well as how wide your screen is to determine
            what image it needs to show.

    Download different images based on pixel densities(Sometimes you have an image that will 
        always be the same size on the screen, but you want to make sure it looks good on high
        resolution devices) -

        <img
            src="logo-200.jpg"
            alt="Our Logo"
            srcset="logo-100.jpg 1x, logo-150.jpg 1.5x, logo-200.jpg 2x"
        />


b)img sizes attribute(image size is not actually the same as the width of your screen, using media
    query we tell which image width should be downloaded) -

    The sizes attribute lets you define relation between img width and screen width, when you do not
        use size attribute, then default value is 100vw. lets say you know your image will be half
        width of screen, then use this -

            <img
                src="tree-1200.jpg"
                alt="A tree"
                srcset="tree-400.jpg 400w, tree-800.jpg 800w, tree-1200.jpg 1200w"
                sizes="50vw"
            />

    
    either a single size for your image, such as 50vw, or a 
        list of media queries that will be used to determine which size your image should be.
        By default when you do not add the sizes attribute to your img it assumes a size of 100vw

    <img
        src="tree-1200.jpg"
        alt="A tree"
        srcset="tree-400.jpg 400w, tree-800.jpg 800w, tree-1200.jpg 1200w"
        sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"
    />

    (max-width: 800px) 100vw has two parts
        a)media query we want to check against
        b)The second part is the size we want to use for our image if the media query is true.
            In this case we are using 100vw which means we want the browser to choose the image
            size based off the full width of the browser window.

        The second item 800px does not have a media query and instead just has a size. This is 
            considered our fallback size. If all the media queries defined before this size are
            false it will use this fallback size instead.What we are saying with this item is
            that our image should be selected assuming our image takes up 800px on the screen.
            The browser will then use this size to determine which image to download.


    Potential pitfalls -
        a)first media query that is matched first is used, so order matters.
            a)you need to reorder your media queries so that the most specific media queries are
                first and the least specific media queries are last.
            b)It is also important to make sure that your default size, the one with no media 
                query, is always last since it always evaluates to true so if it is first it
                will always be picked over any other media query.

        b)percentages size are not supported only px,vw,vh are supported.


c)picture element - Great If you want to show different image(not different image but entirely 
    separate image) on different screen sizes.

    <picture>
        <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="hiking-narrow.jpg" />
        <source media="(max-width: 1000px)" srcset="hiking-medium.jpg" />
        <img src="hiking-wide.jpg" alt="Someone jumping on a hike" />
    </picture>


Why use picture element over alternatives

    when we change the window width, the picture element will show image with less pixel for small
        widths.
