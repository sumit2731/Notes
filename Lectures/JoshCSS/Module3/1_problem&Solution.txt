Problem -
    a)we cannot predict a html element will have which styles by looking at it.
    b)we cannot predict that which element will be targeted by CSS selectors, so it unsafe to chnage a selector.what if 
        we want to chnage style applied to one element but we ended up styles of all other elements.


    React introduced the concept of reusability of complonents rather than sharing of css through classes, js thrpugh functions
        and html through templates. one component should not affect the second component. then we saw a Example where this
        princuple was getting broken in css in react.

Solution -
    here we saw that main goal is to avoid specififcity wars, complexity wars.
    we saw BEM naming. then we saw styles components. in this article we will be using styled components.
