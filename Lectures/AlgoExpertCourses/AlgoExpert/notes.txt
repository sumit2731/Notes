Problems missed in second iteration -

    5) solved it but i was passing slice array in eacg iteartion, insted pass indexes.
    6)kth largestNumber, solved with inOrder but efficient one is reverse in order, does not iterate all nodes and
        does not solve store all nodes.that I was not able to solve.
    7)not able to solve.
        Solved using apporach of 5 but optimal solution is not that.
    8)solved only after i saw the algo


Patterns -
    Questions 5 and 7 involve constructing the binary tree.so see 5 to see how we construct the pattern
