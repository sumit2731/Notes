Feature asset modules is a new feature introduced in Webpack five.
It allows you to easily use asset files in your JavaScript application without installing additional dependencies.

assets - images, fonts, plain text files.

Types of asset modules - see figure1.
    a)asset/resource

        adding rules -
            see webpack.config.js
            So every time we try to import a JPG file, Webpack will check if it has a rule for it.
            If it doesn't find a suitable rule, it will give an error, which means something like the following -
                Unfortunately, I don't know how to import this file. Please tell me what I should do with it.

            On the other hand, if it finds a rule for this file, it will import the file according to the rule.

        Public path(see webpack config comments also) - 
            Public pass tells Webpack which URL to use in order to load all the generated files in the browser.
            For example, if you are using static files like images in your application, you can tell the browser
            where those static files should be taken from using public pass configuration option.

            From Webpack version five, you don't have to worry about this option as much as before.

            If you use webpack version older than 5 then previous setup  wouldn't work for you because you haven't specified
            the public path to your image.But now everything works out of the box in simple cases.

            You should only worry about public paths if your case is not that simple.as of now we will use publicPath: ./dist
                as we will refrence it later

        Controling where assets are copied -
            assetModuleFilename - see config in webpack. also there is link to know more.

            https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#outputfilename

            variable things that you can mention in path -
                [name] - name of file (name of entry point)
                [path] - path to file
                [hash] - hash of file
                [ext] - extension of file

    b)asset/inline - asset/inline module type ,inline's the content of file into the bundle as a data URI.
         generates base 64 representation of your file and bakes it directly into JavaScript.
         very common for smaller resources like svg.
        

    c)asset - file less than 8kb(customizable) then asset/inline otherwise asset/resource
    d)asset/source - Asset source reads the content of the file into a JavaScript string and injects that string
        directly into the JavaScript bundle, as is, without any modifications.


Answered in question - what if i want to place differet assets in different folders?

    module.rule.generaor.fileName (overwrites assetModuleFileName)
    module.rule.generaor also has other options like publicPath for module
