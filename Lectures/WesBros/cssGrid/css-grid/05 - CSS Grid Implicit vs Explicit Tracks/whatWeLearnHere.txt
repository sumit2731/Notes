Here we saw explicit tracks(tracks that we have defined using grid-template-columns or
gird-template-rows) ,implicit tracks(auto created rows or columns when grid items are 
more than explicitly created tracks, or auto created when we place a item outside explicitly
created grid),external grid(formed by explicit tracks) and internal grid(marked by implicit tracks)
in mozilla dev tools.
we can identify as shown in image.

Here we saw that when we have more items than tracks, than by defualt new rows will
be created to accomodate them.then we saw that we have property called "grid-auto-rows", using
it we can size these implicitly created rows. implicit tracks are also created when we place a
item outisde the grid. we will see later, how we can do that.

similarly we have proeprty called "grid-auto-columns", to size implicitly created columns.
but by defualt new items are adjusted by creating new rows, we will see in next lecture,
how we can change it.


property covered-
1)grid-auto-rows
2)grid-auto-columns
