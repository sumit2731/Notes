        <a aria-label="link">Link</a>
    aria-labelledby
        <div id="foo>THis is link</div>

Then we looked at aria mdn docs where all roles, states are mentioned. state are like aria-checked, aria-expanded etc.
when expanded you need to add it and then remove it using js. aria state helps users to know abut current state of appication.
so roles and labels are easy you just need to add them to html but state and proprtiesare little trickier because you need to 
set dynamically via js.


Live regions - whne user books uber cab, user needs to know when driver is coming.

    <div aria-live="assertive">Waiting for a ride</div>

    assertive - will interrupt whatever it's doing to announce.
    polite - will announce the live region update when it next idles.
    off - will not read the update.
