Introducing Lamdba Expression
    see figure 1. here we are assigning a function to a variable.

Lambda Expression Examples
    figure 4 - here we are not giving type to argument, because it will get
        it from left hand side expression.
    you can skip the parenthesis when you have only 1 argument.
    If you do not have {} then it returns whatever is in single statement.

    which is better Object oriented programming or Functional programming -
        some problems are easy to solve in functional programming, some are easy to solve in OOPs.
        Once you learn tools that you have at your displosal for functional programming, you will know where
        functional programming shines, it is not suited for all kind of problems.In Java default programming 
        is OOPS, functional programming is additional tool that is made avalible to you. you cnt just avid OOP
        and do only functional programming in java, it not even possible in java.so its never either-or question.
        if you are working with java, you are doing OOP, choice is would you like to use fucntional programming 
        paradigms, while doing OOP. answer is yes, in certain situations it helps.
