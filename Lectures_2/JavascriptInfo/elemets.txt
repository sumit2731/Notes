1)tagName -gives tag name of element. it is always capital letter, like- BODY
2)innerHtml - Gives everything inside tag. we can also
    modify content.
3)outerHtml - gives innerHtml + element itself. if we oevrwrite, it then we will replace
 the whole element with new one. but js object is not updated. so if you make any
 chnages in old object, it will not reflect in HTML.
4)textContent- provides access to the text inside the element: only text, minus all <tags>.
  Writing to textContent is much more useful, because it allows to write text the “safe way”.
    
    <div id="news">
    <h1>Headline!</h1>
    <p>Martians attack people!</p>
    </div>

    <script>
    // Headline! Martians attack people!
    alert(news.textContent);
    </script>

5)hidden - It is attribute and the DOM property specifies whether the element is visible or not.
    so we can se it both as  a attribute as well as proeprty.Technically, hidden works the same
    as style="display:none". But it’s shorter to write. so elemnt will remain in dom, but will
    not be visible.it will not take any space

    <div>Both divs below are hidden</div>

    <div hidden>With the attribute "hidden"</div>

    <div id="elem">JavaScript assigned the property "hidden"</div>

    <script>
    elem.hidden = true;
    </script>
6)value – the value for <input>, <select> and <textarea> (HTMLInputElement, HTMLSelectElement…).
7)href – the “href” for <a href="..."> (HTMLAnchorElement).
8)id – the value of “id” attribute, for all elements (HTMLElement).
