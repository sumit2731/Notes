here we had width of 50% in code, but when we go to very small devices our width is wasted. so we set
    width to 90%. but now on bigger devices it occupies whole screen. to solve this problem, we use
    max-width:620px, so width increases as we increase browser window. but once it reaches 620px, it 
    cannot grow more. but it can only decrease.


similarly if we set min-width, then container will not go smaller tham that width. when we decraese browser
windw so that its width is smaller than min-width, we will get a scroll bar.


In responsive design it is como to use max-width to give some maximum width.
