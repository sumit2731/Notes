1)Relation between flex-wrap and align-contnt(align-items also) -
    when flex-wrap:wrap-reverse, then align-content: flex-end will work like flex-start and vice-versa.

    same behviour is for align-items also.



2)there are multiple rows in flexbox but align-content property is mot specified. only align-content is specified.In this case how will
    rows will be aligned? so flex-contianer will be divided into number of subcontainers(equal to number of rows), with each container,
    align-content property will align that single row within single container. js fiddle link-

    these sub containrers are formed in such a way that gap bweteen content insie subcontaiber and its boundary is same for all sub containers.
    see figure1


3)using both align-content and align-items -

    here height of each item determines the height of row and then within row we can use align-items to adjust itms.
    
    This is not making sense -
