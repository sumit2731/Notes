lwcture notes -
    effects of giving relative position -
        a)some proeprties are eunlocked - relments moves from its positon without disturing surrounding layout
        b)becomes containing block




Extra from lecture -
    We can use percentage values for left,top,right and bottom. left and right depend upon width of parent.
        top and bottom depend upon height of parent. 


    percentage values -

        top,bottom,height - % of parent's height.
        left,right,width - % of parent's width.

    can we say this? -so we can say that parent is the containing block of relatively positioned 
    element. given the fact that element is positoned(left,right,top and bottom) with respect to its own
    position.
