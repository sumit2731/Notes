here we used grid, there are no media queries in this code but
still our grid is totally responsive. here we used grid inside 
grid and saw how can we control the size of images.

here key thing was to use-
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px , 1fr));
    to see how it behaves, see code in folder 13,minmax-FINISHED.html, pint no.6
-----------------------------------------------
Some oBservations-

here what we saw these were not working-

    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min-content , max-content));
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min-content , 1fr));
    
    it looks like when we use auto-fit or auto-fill with minmax. minmax needs to have
    atleast 1 constant value. so these will work-

     grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min-content , 500px));
     or
     grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px , max-content));
