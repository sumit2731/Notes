1)gird-areas(areas-FINISHED.html)-
    in lectures 9, 10 we saw how we can size and place our grid items.there are other ways
    in which we can size and span our items, this by using grid templates areas.
    it is giving spefic names to areas on your grid.

Properties used -
  1)Grid-properties-
    a)grid-template-areas
  2)grid-items-property-
    a)grid-area

Using grid-area property we can place our item inside the grid. But actually grid area is shorthand for these proeprties-
    grid-column-start, grid-columns-end, grid-row-start, grid-row-end
    all these propeties have value that we have given to grid-area.
You can expnad grid-area in dev tools and see. here thing to be noted is when we create a grid area,
all lines surrouding that area are named of same name as grid.
    

2)lines names with grid areas(area-line-names-FINISHED.html)-
    when we create grid areas, we get lines names for free. that is something we already discuused in point 1.
    Here we saw that how we can specifically mention start and end lines of grid. we did this-
      grid-column: poop-start / poop-end;
    in code we crated a grid, just by defining grid-area ,without defining any columns or rows.then we assigned
    whole gird area to item 3. rest items occupy rest grid. but we run out of space, then
    implicit grid is created. then we saw how can we use start and end lines of area to
    position our items. here we saw that we specifically mention start and end lines of area.
    it means you dnt always have to use line numbers for positioning,you can use areas for positioning.
