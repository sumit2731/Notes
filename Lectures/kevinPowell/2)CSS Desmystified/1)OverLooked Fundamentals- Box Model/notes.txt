box-sizing - 
    content-box(default) - height and width means content only
    border-box - height and width means content + padding + border

Generally this snippet is addeed so that we dnt run into problems explained below-

    *,
    *::before,
    *::after {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

width:auto vs width: 100% for block level element. we get over-flows if we set width. lot of times we do not really need to be
    setting width on many of our elements, this is one off reasons. but setting box-sizing will solve this problem. we also
    saw that setting width: auto and setting width:100%,box-sizing:border-box is equivalent.

When we set height and width in percentage, thne we refer to parent's width and height. if there is no parent then we refer to
viw port.

Height vs width - avoid setting height in genreal. let css handle hights for you.every CSS element has intrinsic height by 
    default i.e height is decided by content inside of it. some times people set height, becuse they want exteded backgroud 
    or somethng,in that case set min-height. because now your height can chnage if you run into small screen and even if you 
    add new content. witout min-height , you will have overflow.

    to get more backround, do not set height, get it by setting padding. now heigth will adjust automaically, accoridng to 
    screen size, you not get overflow and you will always have that emty space.

    One of other resons for setting height is to get same height boxes even if content in them is diffrent. this can be doe by 
    using flexbox as shown in codepen.

    so unless you run into very specific situtaion where you need to declare specific height, for  very specific purpose, you are 
    better off never declaring one.
