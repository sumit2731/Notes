Element dimensions(Geomatrical Properties are zero for element not displayed, unless specified, all of these are 
    read-only) -

    When can geomatical properties be null or zero -
        when element is hidden
        we have created the element but it not inserted into DOM

    a)offsetParent

        The offsetParent is the nearest ancestor that the browser uses for calculating coordinates during rendering.
        That’s the nearest ancestor that is one of the following:

            CSS-positioned (position is absolute, relative, fixed or sticky), or
            <td>, <th>, or <table>, or
            <body>.

        offsetParent can be null for follwoing -
            For not shown elements (display:none or not in the document).
            For <body> and <html>.
            For elements with position:fixed.


        Properties offsetLeft/offsetTop provide x/y coordinates relative to offsetParent upper-left corner.

    b)offsetLeft/offsetTop - Properties offsetLeft/offsetTop provide x/y coordinates relative to offsetParent upper-left 
        corner.

    c)offsetWidth/offsetHeight
        content + padding + scrollbar + border

        It does not include the height of pseudo-elements such as ::before or ::after

    d)clientTop/clientLeft - leftBorder/topBorder
        …But to be precise – these properties are not border width/height, but rather relative coordinates of the inner 
        side from the outer side.

        when language is right to left, then scrollbar is on left, then it includes border + scrollBar


    e)clientWidth/clientHeight
        content + padding(scrollbar not included)

        note - scrollbar width is taken from content width(not true for all browser)It can also include the height of 
            pseudo-elements such as ::before or ::after

        Doubt - Even for scroll bar.

    f)scrollHeight/scrollWidth - It is the full inner height of the content area including the scrolled out parts.
        this is min length that element would need so that it will not need scrollbar.If there is no scrollbars then
        this is equal to clientWidth/clientHeight.

    g)scrollTop/scrollLeft - How much we have scroll inside element. w ecan chnage this properties to have element
        scrolled.so this can be modified.



Don’t take width/height from CSS -

    do not take height from getComputedStyle, because of follwoing -

        a)CSS width/height depend on another property: box-sizing that defines “what is” CSS width and height. A change in
            box-sizing for CSS purposes may break such JavaScript.

        b)CSS width/height may be auto, for instance for an inline element.
        c)Scrollbar - read from blog
