Here we are aoplying animation property dynamically through js. we are using using style prop.



Handling interruptions(play states) -
    animation-play-state


    Before, we were dynamically applying and removing the animation altogether. In this updated example, the animation is always applied 
        (inside the Box styled-component), but we dynamically toggle it between running and paused.

    paused works like the pause button on a remote control. Everything freezes in place. Toggling it back to running will pick up from 
        where it left off.
    Not many animations require "pause" functionality, but it's a neat property to have in your back pocket!

        timing-function - liner | ease | ease-in | ease-out | cubic-bezier(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)
        delay 
        iteration-count - 1 |2 |infinite
        direction - normal(default) | reverse | alternate |alternate-reverse
        fill-mode - none(default) |forward | backwards | both
        play-state: running| pause
