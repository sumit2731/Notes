/* 
    Re-rendering is how React updates components with new data. Without re-renders, there will be no interactivity in our 
        apps.
    State update is the initial source of all re-renders.
    If a component's re-render is triggered, all nested components inside that component will be re-rendered.
    During the normal React re-renders cycle (without the use of memoization), props change doesn't matter: components will 
        re- render even if they don't have any props.
    We can use the pattern known as "moving state down" to prevent unnecessary re-renders in big apps.
    State update in a hook will trigger the re-render of a component that uses this hook, even if the state itself is not 
        used.
    In the case of hooks using other hooks, any state update within that chain of hooks will trigger the re-render of a 
        component that uses the very first hook.
