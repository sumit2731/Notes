To change font -
    font-family: Arial;

    It's called a “family” because each font consists of multiple character sets: for example, “Roboto” includes 12 
    individual sets: 6 font weights, with 2 variants (normal and italic).


    There are a handful of “web safe fonts”. These are fonts that come pre-installed on all major operating systems- 
        Arial
        Times New Roman
        Tahoma.



    Font families come in different styles. The 3 most popular:

        Serif
        Sans-serif
        Monospace

custom fonts -

    Alternatively, we can pick a custom font (AKA a web font)! In order for this to work, we'll need to instruct the 
    browser to download the fonts we're missing.
    
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

        When using a web font, it's customary to surround it in quotation marks -
            font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;


    When using a web font, it's customary to surround it in quotation marks. This is technically only required if the font name has multiple 
    words, but it's a good convention regardless.
    
    Here's how we'd use that Google font:

            font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;

3 most common formatting options:

    a)bold - We can create bold text with the font-weight property:

        font-weight: bold;

        There's also a numbering system, from 1 to 1000, which lets us control the font weight more precisely:

            /* Light, thin text*/
            font-weight: 300;
            /* Normal text */
            font-weight: 400;
            /* Heavy, bold text */
            font-weight: 700;

        The default value for font weight is 400, and the bold keyword maps to 700.


    b)italic -

        font-style: italic;

        Similar to bold text, the browser can simulate italic text by rendering the characters at an angle. For best results, though, we should 
        supply an italic character set.
    
    c)Underlined text - We can toggle an element's underline with the text-decoration property:

        /* remove underlines from anchor tags: */
        a {
            text-decoration: none;
        }

Alignment -
    We can shift characters horizontally using the text-align property. to see details of how text-align works, see this-
        CSS basics/centerAlignment

Text-transform -

    /* RENDER WITH ALL CAPS */
    text-transform: uppercase;
    /* Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Word */
    text-transform: capitalize;

Spacing -

    We can tweak the spacing of our characters in two ways.

        a)We can tweak the horizontal gap between characters using the letter-spacing property.
            letter-spacing: 3px;
        
        b)We can tweak the vertical distance between lines using the line-height property.
