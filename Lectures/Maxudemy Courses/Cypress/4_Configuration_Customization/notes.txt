50)The global config file
    the config file is cypress.config.js
    some config - video location, encryption of video, takes pics on error etc.

51)Understanding Timeouts
    cypress runs commands untill they pass or untill timeout.
    There are various kind of timeouts, you can see them via intellisense in cypress.config.js.

52)Global vs local config
    local config can be passed as object as second argument in it or describe.

53)Setting the browser
    ways to set browser -
        a)cypress open
            select the browser
        b)cypress run
            cypress run --browser firefox
        c)In it or descrobe block, pass cconfig as second argument and mention this -
            {browser: firefox}

54)baseUrl
     we setup the baseUrl option in cypress config in e2e config proeprties. as it applies to e2e tests only.

55)Sharing logic wwith hooks
    before()
    beforeAll()

    after
    afterAll()

    these can be added at page level or test suite level

    It is reccommneded to use before and beforeAll even for cleanUp work also. so we have test env ready for test before starting the
        test.

56)Introducing Custom Commands and Queries
    see slide 18 to see difference between these.

57)Creating a Custom Command

    Creating custom command (cypress/support/commands.js) -
        
        Cypress.Commands.add('submitForm', () => {
            cy.get('form button[type="submit"]').click();
        });

    Using custom comamnd -
        cy.submitForm();

    you shoud not create commands for everything
