187)what are 'custom hooks'
188)Creating a Custom React Hook Functions - 
    custom hook created in - hooks/use-counter.js
189)using custom hook function
    custom hooks used in ForwardCounter.js
190)congiguring custom hooks
    used same hook in BackwardCounter.js by cutomomizing our hook, that is it accepts a parameter.

191 ) here we have project 2. here app.js and NewTask.js, have similar logic of making api call and then updating loading and error
    state we can outsource the logic into separate function, but since logic involves use of react state and react hook, here normal
    function wnt do the trick because there we are not allowed to use hooks,so we need custom hook as we have stateful logic here.

192)here we built a custom http hook. see working folder of code 2 for my solution.
    see code2/working2 for course solution.
