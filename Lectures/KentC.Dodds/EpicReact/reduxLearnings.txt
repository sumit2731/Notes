connect - creates a wrapper component and sets up componentShould update in such a way that, mapToProps is called only when
    sate value is different than last one.

    connect(mapStateToProps)(App); 

mapToProps - component re renders when this returns a diffrent value than last one.It should be in expensive to run. for complex
    computations use memorized selectors.

selectors - these should have transafomation logic in them. they can trsnform state into data required by component.
    Component is rerendered when selector returns object with different values.This takes our mapToProps function, which
    was earlier passed to connect.

memorizedSelectors - How they avoid complex computations and component re renders.
