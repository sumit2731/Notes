Inline-block-

    Inline block are best of both words, inline-block elements stays in same line and we can also apply
        width,height,margin(also top-bottom) and padding.

we use inline-block where we need elements to stay in line but we should be able to set width and height on them.
    button is such a common usecase. by defualt buttin is inline-block.

In code we style regular a tags as buttons. but we were not ablt of give it margin or padding in top-bottom direction, 
so we chnaged them to inline-block.

Tips to style buttons(these tips also applies when you try to style other elements as button. like we are doing it here,
    here we style a tag as buttons)-

1)put class directly on a tag, to who which we are making look like button or on button directly..In code we have 2 types
 of buttons. In second set of buttons class is not on a tag.so to click on a tag we have to click exactly on text.while 
 in first case we can click anywhere in button.
2)always use padding to create the "size" of the button, and not width and height. it is because if we give padding, 
    then content will be centered automatically , if we use width and height then we have to center content manually. 
    vertical centering is difficult. also if we dnt use padding then if buttons have diffrent text then amount of 
    emty space(on left and right side) will be different.so it looks awkward.also some times content of button is so 
    long, that it breaks out.

3)padding of left and right needs to be bigger number than, padding top-bottom. this makes button look balanced. generally i use, 1:2 or 1: 2.5.
    at the end it all depends how you want your button to look. ydnt stick yourself to this. it is something that kevin found out by looking at
    other peoples's button. so you can also take inspiration form other people's work.
