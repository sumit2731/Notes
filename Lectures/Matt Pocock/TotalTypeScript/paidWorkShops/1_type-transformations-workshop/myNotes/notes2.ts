 * 23 - infer can be used in conditional types. read TS handbook docs to see how to use infer.
 *
 * 24 - a bit different use of infer to extract arguments from generics. or we can say that
 *  we can extract out type arguments to another type helper
 *
 * 25 - using infer on template literals and using template literals as capturing groups
 *
 * 26 - powerful paradigm of extracting something out from functions without having to declare types
 *   on them
 *
 * 27 - new way of using infer. which helps us to avoid nested ternaries
 *
 * 28 - distributive nature of generics in condiitonal types (important)
