    you should not test -
        thrid party code
        code or features built into the envirement you are working on(do not test browser api's, do not test native node.js
            packages)
    see slode1

35)writing good test
    a)AAA
    b)test only one thing - Do not write test that test three different aspects of functions or 3 different functions.
    c)Focus on essence of test when arranging
    d)keep assertions minimal

38)Refactoring code
    we broke a larger function which was doing many things into smaller functions. now these individual units can be tested
        separately.
