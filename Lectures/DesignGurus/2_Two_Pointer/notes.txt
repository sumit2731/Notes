5)I solved the question after having a incorrect solution, my solution and course's solution were exactly same.
6) quetsions was same as 5, but i took lot of time in solving, also some slight conditions were wrong, which i found while
    debugging only. also course solution is shorter and eliminates the need of maintaining sum.
    overall good problem.
7)code was right, you missed a important condition. even coding editor was not able to track the error. good question
8)totally blank with this question,visited it later.
9)dutchFlag problem - problem was very simple. but i cnt solve it because algo wa sbit complex.
10)solved this my myself but question was good. also in my solution there were some extra loops.
11)initially i understood the quwstion wrong and solved it. but later took some time to solve this.
12)algo wise i was blank. but when i saw algo in solution, then solved on my own. but dis'bt thought if edge case, i.e when array is
    already sorted.
