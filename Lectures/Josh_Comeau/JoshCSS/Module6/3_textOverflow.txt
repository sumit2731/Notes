Suppose we want to add a space to our paragraph, but in a way that doesn't create a soft wrap opportunity. In other words,
    a space that can't be used to line-break.

    There is a special HTML entity that can be used in this case: &nbsp;


oveflow-wrap (word-wrap in IE)
    break-word: tweaks the text-placing algorithm. If the browser realizes that it can't fit the current word, and it 
        doesn't have any spare soft wrap opportunities, this declaration gives the browser permission to break after any 
        character.

hyphens: auto;
    
    /* Prefix for Safari */
    -webkit-hyphens: auto;


text-oveflow (need overflow:hidden to work)
    ellipsis
    clip

multiline ellipsis
    p {
    display: -webkit-box;
    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
    -webkit-line-clamp: 3;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin-bottom: 1em;
  }
