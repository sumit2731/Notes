Common Mistakes -
    1)concat does not modify orignal array. we need to store result in new arra.
        arr = arr.concat(returnedArray);
        but general tendency is to do this -
        arr.concat(returnedArray), but here orignal array is not modified.
    2)push takes element not array.

Helpful functions -

    1)Arrays - 
        push - Code 7(here induival iteration return elemnt, but corner case returns array)
        concat(see example 7)
    2)string - slice. using negative index


Problem 4, is good. solved it. see how can we combine retun values from multiple function calls.
problem no 5 and 7, see how to combine arrays in recursion. using push and concat.
IN Problem 9, see all approahes.




I was not able to solve 4.
    1)In solution of 4 see, how can we combine retun values from multiple function calls
    2)in course solution of 5, see that we can also use push to combine output of multiple function calls
    3)In solution 6,see how we combines returned values of multiple functon calls
