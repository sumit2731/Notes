The window.postMessage() method safely enables cross-origin communication between Window objects; e.g., between a page and 
    a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it.


    targetWindow.postMessage(message, targetOrigin, [transfer]);
     window.addEventListener("message", (event));
