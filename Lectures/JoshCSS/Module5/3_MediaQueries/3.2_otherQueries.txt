“Interaction Media Features” -  They allow us to apply styles based on which input mechanism the user is using. see table
    @media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)

    this media query will help us to avoid hover state in mobile.

    hover is the ability for a device to move the cursor without also triggering a click/tap on the element underneath
    pointer refers to the level of control the user has over the position of the cursor.


Boolean logic in media queries  
    @media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) 
    @media screen and (min-width: 600px) - screen is a “media type”. In this case, we're saying that the styles should only 
        apply when displaying the site/app on a screen. We can also specify print styles which apply when the page is printed
        onto paper or saved as a PDF.
  
if we want to specify that any of the conditions can be met, we can use a comma:

    @media (max-width: 600px), (min-width: 800px) {
        /* styles */
    }

    This is effectively the same as creating two entirely-separate media queries:

    @media (max-width: 600px) {
        /* styles */
    }

    @media (min-width: 800px) {
        /* Repeated styles */
    }

Preference-based media queries

    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        /* Dark-mode styles here */
    }

    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
        /* Animations here */
    }


Orientation -

    @media (orientation: portrait) {
        /* Styles for windows that are taller than they are wide */
    }
