see main notes for this property, here we can see that if we increase the height of second item, 
    then height of whole first row is increased. use this trick if you want to make items of equal height.
    we use lot js hacks to do that.

One more thing to notice here is in fourth row we have only one item. we have centered it using justify-content. so
    in case of multiple rows justify content works on individual row. also because of justify-content:center, if there 
    is any space left in other rows, items will be aligned.

align-items vs align-content - both are used to align items around cross section. when should we use which one?
    
    when thee are multiple rows. then we can do 2 things-
    
    1)how each rows should be arranged in contianer.for this use align-content. align-content will "only work" if flex-wrap
        is on, otherwise there will be no effect of it.
    2)How each item should be arranged in its row along cross axis. use align-items

    To demonstrate above point use align-content: stretch and align-items: center. you will see difference. see fgure 1.

    when there is one row then by default value of align-content is stretch. so all over container we have one row.but inside
    that row we use align-items to arrange our item. see figure 2.


Question - weird behavious happens if we remove :) and give some height: 200px to any item. there is some unusual gap.
