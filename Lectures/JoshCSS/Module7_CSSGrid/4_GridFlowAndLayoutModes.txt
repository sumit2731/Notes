Implicit Grid - We haven't told the engine what the rows and columns should be, and so it's come up with its
    own grid, based on the number of children.By default, it creates 1 new row for each element. Because our
    grid parent is given 3 children, we'll wind up with a 1x3 grid.This is known as an Implicit grid.

    .wrapper {
        display: grid;
    }

    Implicit grids want to fill the available space. Notice that the elements stretch across the horizontal
        space like block-level elements in Flow.If we give our grid a fixed height, we notice the same 
        behaviour with rows.height of rows is such that it occupies full height of container.

    Because our grid is 300px tall, each row winds up being 100px tall. Each element in our grid spans the
        entire width and height of its cell by default.

    dev tools helps us to see how grids row-columns, areas or, tracks are laid out, which helps us to 
        understand why element is positioned at a place and what is size of this element.in grid, the lines
        are the primary thing that we track by. So it's not really a matter of this element being in the first
        row,it's actually more accurate to say that this element is spanning from row line 1 to row line 2, and
        it's spanning from column line 1 to column line 2.


Grid auto flow


display:inline-grid
    container will have display:inline, and children will have grid layout
