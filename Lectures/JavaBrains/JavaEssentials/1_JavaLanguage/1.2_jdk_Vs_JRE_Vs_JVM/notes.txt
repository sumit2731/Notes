JDK - 
    JavaSDK - allows you to write java code, compile it and generate byte code,package it into a 
        application.it comes with run time.
        needs only for developing java programs not running them.if you just to run java programs,
        written by someone else,you do not need JavaSDK. 

        It has JavaRun time because if you develop java applications, you would want to run them.
        before giving to others.

JRE -
    It is language agnostic, does care from where .class was generated, it just runs them.
    It is different for different machines.

JVM - Java Virtual machine. It is program that runs the byte code.
    Point 4 - Instead of JVM running the code, JVM can convert byte code into machine level code,
        which machine can execute without JVM being into a picture.There are certain optimizations
        which machine coe can do and one of them is convert some code directly into machine code.
