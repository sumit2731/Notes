type 1 -
    The first and by far most popular type are pseudo elements that allow you to add content to
    your HTML from CSS

    :before - allow you to add one child element as the first element of whatever element you are
        selecting in your CSS.
    :after - allow you to add one child element as the last child element of whatever element you
        are selecting in your CSS.

type 2 -
    allow you to treat specific sections of your HTML as if they were their own element. 
    
    Good examples of this are the ::first-letter and ::first-line pseudo element that allow you
        to style the first letter or line of text as if it was its own element.

    Another example is the ::selection pseudo element that allows you to style the text that is 
    highlighted.
