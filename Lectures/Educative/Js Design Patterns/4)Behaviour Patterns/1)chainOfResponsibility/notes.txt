The chain of responsibility pattern allows a request sent by a client to be received by more than one object. It creates a 
    chain of loosely-coupled objects that, upon receiving the request, either handle it or pass it to the next handler 
    object.

A common example of this pattern is event bubbling in DOM. An event propagates through different nested elements of the 
    DOM until one of them handles it.


You can use it if your program is written to handle various requests in different ways without knowing the sequence and type
 of requests beforehand. It allows you to chain several handlers, thus, allowing all of them a chance to process the request.

A good example of the use of the chain of responsibility pattern is in the process of event bubbling in the DOM, where the
 event propagates through the nested elements, one of which may choose to handle the event.
