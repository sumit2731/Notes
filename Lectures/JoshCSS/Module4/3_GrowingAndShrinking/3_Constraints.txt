In flex-grow,flex-shrink,flex-basis all respect min-width/max-width, min-height/max-height.

In Main Axis we set the hypothetical width, height. actualu height depends on flex-grow, flex-shrink and container size. but it
    will constraint by min-width/max-width.

In Cross axis we set align-items is stretch but a height is given then that height will be respected. similarly min/max-height 
    is also respected.


Exercise 1 -

    here again wanted one column to be 1/3rd of total width. so used flex-basis:0 trick. to solve it. also we gave max-width to both
        columns.

Exercise 2(imp) -
    Problem -
        1)we have 3 columns as shown in video. when one column disappears, then for some time, right side bar should shrink.
            after some shrinking, then it stops and then middle columns starts shrink.middle content is main area.
        2)At very large width only middle one shrinks. but after shrinking for some time, then main stops and nav and aside
            one starts shrinking.

    Solution -
        why one column stops shrinking(main column is not shrinking for some time when first column disappears) -
            a)It has already its min-width. now this cannot be case beacuse after some time column again starts shrinking.
            b)other column has very high value of flex-shrinking.

        so situtaion is when first column disapapears, 3rd column is between its flex-basis and min-width. middle column
            is also at flex-basis.since flex-shrink of 2nd column is very so it starts shrinking. after some time it hits
            its min size, so it stops shrinking and middle column starts shrinking.

        so we need to set flex-basis for both columns in such a way when one column disapears width is slightly less than their
         flex basis so that shrinking is happening.
