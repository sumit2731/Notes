// Alex from tRPC explains how they use generics to construct a reusable context

/**
 * see  folder 2 in otherLibraryCode.
 *
 * Here we saw that instead of using global type, we can inject the types into a type by using generics.
 * They inject types into TInit and then everything build on TInit has all it types refrenced
 *
 * They are using the pattern discussed in 17.5 this is using builder pattern
