1)Dialog -
    1)should be focused when dilog is opened.
    2)when closed focus should go back to where it was before opening.
    3)focus trapping.
    4)pressing escape should close it.

2)Good heading strucure.
    One h1 per page
    if you cnt change html use role="heading" and level.
    
3)Have proper landmarks
    banner - header (can be multiple, only inside body is main)
    navigation - navbar
    main - main (should be direct child of body)
    contentInfo - footer(durect child of body)
    complimantary - aside
    form - role="form", with accessible name
    search - no html element, role="search"
    region - 
        role="region" and give it accessible name. it does not describe the content it contains, so you need to give it a 
                    accessible name, that describes the purpose of content inside of it.prefably it shuld have a heading which we
                    can refer by aria-labeledby.
                section tag - there is no html elment for this role but section element is exposed as landmark when prrovided with
                    accessible name. section tag does not affect the poutline of document anymore.

4)even when you use link as  button, all corrosponding behaviour should be implemented.

5)implementing navigation bar -
    1)use nav tag
    2)give it a name, so that it can tell what is purpose of this like breadcrums, main navigation etc
    3)links should be inside ul so that count is announced.
    4)mark current area by using aria-current="true"


6)implementing tab -

    <div role="tablist">
        <button role="tab">Overview</button>
        <button role="tab">Specifications</button>
        <button role="tab">..</button>
        ..

        <section role="tabpanel">
            ..
        </section>
    </div>
