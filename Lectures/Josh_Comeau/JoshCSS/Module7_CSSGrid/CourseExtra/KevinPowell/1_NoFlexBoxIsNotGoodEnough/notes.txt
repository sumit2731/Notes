1)You have 2 rows -
    first row has 3 columns, second one has 2. second row elements occupy full width, so it looks
    uneven.
    
    solution 1 with flexbox -
        use flex-basis:33% on each column, but columns do not allign perfectly(2nd column on first and
        second row are not align) as columns do have gap between them and it was not considered while
        giving flex-basis: 33%, so flex box shrinks the content in first column.

    solution 2 with flexbox -
        use flex-wrap:wrap
        and decrease the width from 33% to accomodate the gap.

    solution with css grid -
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)


    Another problem with flexbox - if you use padding in flex-children then width of children will be
        different.

2)responsiveness with -

    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fitt, minmax(300px, 1fr))

    doing this kind of layout with flexbox without media query is bit tricky.



3)making elements span across columns and rows.
    you can make element


4)makingContent overlap.
