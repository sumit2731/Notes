In code2 of lst lecture we used separte class name instead of uisng compound selectors.
    but as you can see in code2, we have to repaest ourself a lot with button styles.

    solution is to use 2 classes on elemnt instead of 1. First we create a generic button class
    -btn.here we come up with general btn class. all common styles are moved there.
    
    then we come up with second class,modifier class which will just deal with colors.

So it is reccommended to use  single class approach a smuch as possible, but if we need to use compund selectors,
     we know how to use them.

We should follow DRY principle. we can write code in less lines and that code becomes versatile. now if we want to add
    new button we just need to write add btn class to it. where as if we are using that comma appraoch(defining 
    common styles togather by using comma separated selectors and then defining specific styles later in code using 
    same class name), then we need to add new class to comma separted list and then define specific styles for that
    class somewhere in code. so writing code like this makes your code a lot versatile and eeasier to mke things that are
    component based, which is lot important part behind writing css these days.
