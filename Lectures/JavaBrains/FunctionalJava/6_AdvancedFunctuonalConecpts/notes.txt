Lambda Calling Labdas Calling Lambdas
    See figure 1.
    passing lambda to another lambda is main concept in functional programming.This illsutrates
    functions as first class entities.what you can do with this is create composable functions,
    you can compose functions from another functions. there are different techbniques for this -

    a)higher order functions
    b)currying

    All these are techbniques from which you can create complex functions out fo simple functions and get
    more variotions. it is like you are building small pieces which are these individual functions and then
    composing them to form something bigger. for demo see LambdaComposability.java.

    Curryiing - You have lambda which takes n argument. we create another lambda which calls that thing
    but you pass one argument by defualt and then  have another 2 argumnets passed to it. so wrappwer 
    lambda takes 2 argumnets but it sends 3 argumnets to inner lambda, with strict option about what 1 
    argument is.

    You you have n-1 argument lambda calling n argument lambda, with 1 defualt argument.
