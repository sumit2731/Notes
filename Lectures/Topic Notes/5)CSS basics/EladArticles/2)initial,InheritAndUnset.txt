initial - All css properties have initial value, this value set that value for a particular css proeprty.

inherit - The keyword value of inherit tells the browser to search for the closest parent element’s value and let the current
 element inherit that value. If the closest parent has an inherit value too, the browser will continue going up the DOM until
 it finds some value. If there isn’t any value, the browser will use its user-agent style, and if there isn’t any user-agent 
 style, it will use the initial base style.

unset - if property is inherited then it is equivaltent to inherit.
        if property is not inheritable then this is equivalent to initial.

revert - If a property is normally inherited, revert means inherit.
        If a property is normally not inherited, revert reverts to the value specified in the browser style sheet.
