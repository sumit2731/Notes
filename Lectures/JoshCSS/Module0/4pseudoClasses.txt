Pseudo-classes let us apply a chunk of CSS based on an element's current state. In this case, we're adding a blue text color when the 
element is hovered.

Different Pseudo Classes -

a):hover
b):focus
c):checked

Pseudo-classes aren't just for states like hover/focus/checked! They can also help us apply conditional logic.

d)first/last child

    syntax -
        selector:first-child {}

        This means element selected by selector should be first/final element within its container. It needs to be the first/last child 
        within its parent.
    
    syntax example -
        <style>
            p {
                margin-bottom: 1em;
            }
            p:last-child {
                margin-bottom: 0px;
            }
        </style>

        <section>
            <p>This is a paragraph!</p>
            <p>This is another paragraph!</p>
            <p>
                What do you know, it's a third
                paragraph!
            </p>
        </section>

    See css notes of PseudoClasses to see trick with first-child.


e):first-of-type / :last-of-type
     They're almost identical with first/last-child, but they have one critical difference.:first-of-type depends on the type of the HTML 
     tag

    code -
        html -

        <section>
            <h1>Hello world!</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph!</p>
            <p>This is another paragraph!</p>
        </section>

        css -

            <style>
                
                p:first-child {
                    color: red;
                }
                
                p:first-of-type {
                    color: red;
                }
            </style>

    here p:first-child is looking for situations where a paragraph is the first child within a parent container. It doesn't work in this case.
    first-of-type works as it ignores any siblings that aren't of the same type.In this case, p:first-of-type is going to select the first 
    paragraph within a container, regardless of whether or not it's the first child.
