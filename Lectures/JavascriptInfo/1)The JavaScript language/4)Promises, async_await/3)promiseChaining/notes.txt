1)a call to promise.then returns a promise, so that we can call the next .then on it.
2)When a handler returns a value, it becomes the result of that promise, so the next .then is called with it.
3)this is called promise chaining, see example1 in code.
4)A handler, used in .then(handler) may create and return a promise.In that case further handlers wait until it 
    settles, and then get its result. see exmale 2.

5)now use of promise chaining to load scripts, one after another. code block 2

6)cases where isntead of promise chaining we have to promise nesting. code block3.

7)thenable objects can be retruned from handlers passed to then.(see blog)

8)see question at the last, difference between -
    promise.then(f1).catch(f2);
    promise.then(f1, f2);
