Default Behaviour (if you do not mention any rows and columns) -
    Then it will create n number of rows for n children and each row will have width equal which fills the
        contianer and height that is enough for children. Also children width is equal to width of row.
   
    THis is called ImplicitGrid.Implicit grids want to fill the available space. Notice that the elements 
        stretch across the horizontal space like block-level elements in Flow.
    If we give our grid a fixed height, we notice the same behaviour with rows.
    Each element in our grid spans the entire width and height of its cell by default.but we can
    control it by giving width and height to element.
    

grid - Columns * Rows, by default grid will have -
    a)1 * n - can be changed with grid-auto-flow
    b)grid children will expand to occupy full cell.


display:inline-grid
    container will have display:inline, and children will have grid layout

Grid children are positioned according to grid layout, things like display:inline does not have any affect
    in grid layout.However if child has layout module as positioned then that element does not participate
    in flow layout.As far as the parent grid is concerned, this element doesn't exist.
