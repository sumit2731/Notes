Objects that can be used in for..of are called iterable.Iterable objects are a generalization of arrays. That’s a concept 
    that allows us to make any object useable in a for..of loop.

known itebales in js -

    array
    keys
    map
    set
    map.keys, map.values , map.entries
    set.keys, set.values, set.entries


How to define iterable -
    a)we need to add a method to the object named Symbol.iterator (a special built-in symbol just for that).
    b)he method must return an iterator – an object with the method next.
    c)Onward, for..of works only with that returned object.
    d)When for..of wants the next value, it calls next() on that object.
    e)The result of next() must have the form {done: Boolean, value: any}, where done=true means that the iteration is 
        finished, otherwise value is the next value.


Using iterable -

    1)It can be used in for in loop.
    2)we can get iterable using [Symbol.iterator] and use it in while loop.


Iterables and array-like - 

    Iterables are objects that implement the Symbol.iterator method, as described above.
    Array-likes are objects that have indexes and length, so they look like arrays.

    strinks are both iterable and array-like.


Creating Array form (iterable or array like object) -
    
    use Array.from(iterable)
    use Array.from(array_like_object)
