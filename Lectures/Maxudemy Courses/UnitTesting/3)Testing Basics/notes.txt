it or test - these can be used intrchangebably in boh jest and vitest.can we used without exporting by adding --global 
    flag. but importing gives better auto completion.

AAA - Arrange, Act and assert. slide1.

best practices -
    a)write more than 1 test.
    b)also test for certain things that we do not want to happen(values that we expect to get if invalid values get passed)
see test in math.test to know how to test whether a function throws error or not.
