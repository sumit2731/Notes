57)Introducing Event Filters and Activity types
    slide 36,37

58)Using Activity Type
    here we saw how we can mention activity type for event.
    also along with mentioning activity type , how we can mention multiple events

    file - demo1.yml

59)Using Events filters
    you can see event filters in github docs under workflow syntax.
        https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushbranchestagsbranches-ignoretags-ignore

    As of now github actions supports filters for push pull request and workflow_call (covered later)

    types of filter - branches, branches-ignore, paths,paths-ignore

    also you can use wildcard filters and regular expressions. in the above doc there is cheatsheet at last. check to see what can be used.
    u=in demo1.yml, see difference between * and **.

    in our workflow we attached different filters.
        branches and paths-ignore

60)Special behaviour with forks
    If some one folks your repo and opens a PR then if that matches the filters, workflow will still not 
    triggered, for first time contributers you need to approve it manually. after that it will run automatically.
    for collaborators, this will run automatically even for first time, because these are people that you trust.

61)Cancelling and skipping workflow (slide 39)
    cancelling the workflow -
        when workflow is running it can be canceled, via UI.
        when a job in workflow fails, it is canceled(this setting can be changed)
        when a step in job again that cancels the workflow(this setting can be changed)

    how to skip - 
        push workflows -
            commit message needs to be of specific format
            commit message - any message [skip ci or actions]
        pull request workflows -
            if last commit of pr has above message, then workflow will be skipped

        This link contains all message formats that will make the workflow skip.
