Data Structures are collection of values. they contain relationship between those values and the functionality
    or operations that can be applied to data. In Data Structures we have relationsip between each piece of data,
    it is randomly deciding how to store it.

    Like in array elemnts are store by their indexes and we have bunch of built in functions.


why There are so many?

    because diffrent data structures excel at different things. we need to know about them so that we can decide
    where to use which.

Why I Care-

    The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures. You've already 
    worked with many of them unknowingly!. if you have interacted with DOm, then you have worked with tree.

then colt explained the situations where different data structues excel. go through them when you are done with ds.
