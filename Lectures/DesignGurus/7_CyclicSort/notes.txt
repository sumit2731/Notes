1)failed to solve 1, but logic was very simple.
2)2 and 3 -> have a look at them
4)have a look at similar problem after you cover fast and slow pointers
6)I solved this
7)solved this but missed one condition
8)good question - see this. after lot of thinking I was able to solve this.

2nd Iteration -

2) Solved but modified orignal array
3)My algo was wrong
4)course solution is better, does need to complete 1 iteration
8)algo was wrong, later corrected it on my own.



Star Questions -
    1)8 (It becomes easy after attempting 7, so directly attempt this)


Important - 
    4)have a look at similar problem after you cover fast and slow pointers
