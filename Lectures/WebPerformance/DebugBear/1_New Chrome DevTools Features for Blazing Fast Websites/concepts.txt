"Resource Load Delay" in LCP
    Resource Load Delay evaluates how quickly the browser identifies and starts downloading the LCP element after 
    receiving the server response.This delay can occur due to several factors:
        Render-blocking resources: CSS and JavaScript files that prevent the browser from quickly identifying and
            loading the LCP element4.
        Discovery time: The time it takes for the browser to parse the HTML and discover the LCP resource.
        Prioritization: How quickly the browser prioritizes the loading of the LCP resource among other page elements.

    Strategies to Reduce Resource Load Delay - 
        a)Preload critical resources: Use the <link rel="preload"> tag to prioritize loading of the LCP element.
        b)Optimize CSS delivery: Generate critical CSS and inline it in the <head> of the document to reduce render-blocking.
        c)Defer non-critical JavaScript: Use async or defer attributes on script tags to prevent JavaScript from blocking the
            parsing of the HTML3.
        d)Prioritize above-the-fold content: Ensure that the LCP element is discoverable early in the HTML structure.
        e)Use fetchpriority attribute: Apply fetchpriority="high" to the LCP resource to signal its importance to the
         browser7.


Optimizing LCP -
    a)In html we can add some resources to be prefetched using link tag.
    b)in server we can have early hints to tell browser to download some assets early.
    c)we can use fetchpriority attribute
        <img src="hero.jpg" fetchpriority="high" alt="Hero section image">
