Here we’ll see how to implement Drag’n’Drop using mouse events.

    Drag’n’Drop algorithm
        The basic Drag’n’Drop algorithm looks like this:

        a)On mousedown – prepare the element for moving, if needed (maybe create a clone of it, add a class to it 
            or whatever).
        b)Then on mousemove move it by changing left/top with position:absolute.
        c)On mouseup – perform all actions related to finishing the drag’n’drop.


Potential drop targets (droppables)

    We need to know:

        where the element was dropped at the end of Drag’n’Drop – to do the corresponding action,
        and, preferably, know the droppable we’re dragging over, to highlight it.
