Phase 1 -

    Intrefaces -
        Can be used for objects, functions.
        ts performance wiki says inerfaces are faster than types.(speed of type checker)

    Types -
        types can be used for everything

    Conclusion - Use interfaces everywhere.

Phase 2 -
    doe'nt matter if you use types or interfaces as long as you are consistent.
        every object should be typed as interface and everything else should be types as type.
        or use types for everything, then it should be fine.

    interfaces has some of their own proeprties, they can do things which types can never do like -
        inheriting a interface

    Conclusion - they are basically the same.

Phase 3-
    interfaces comes with bundles of features, that you probably don'nr care about especially if you just use interface to 
    define basic object types.

        1)declarationMerging - if you define 2 interfaces with same name in same scope. they are merged togather.this is crtical feature
        of ts if you want to support diffrent things appending to window object.

    conclusion - use types until you need specifci feature of interfaces.

        if you need a type that extends another type, use interface.
        if you want to say this class extends interface, use interface
