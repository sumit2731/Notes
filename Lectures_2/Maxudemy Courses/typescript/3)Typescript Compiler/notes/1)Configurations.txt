1)watch mode
    tsc app.ts --watch or tsc app.ts -w
    now when ever we chnage ts file, it is automatically compiled to js.

2)creating tsconfig file
    navigate to folder, where you have your project,run this command- 
     tsc --init
    this will initilaize this project(where you run this command) as typescript project,
    that means it will now basically tell typescript that everything in the folder, where
    you run this command(therefore it is important that you navigate into right folder before
    you run this command) is a typescript project.so thsi project is now managed by typescript.
    It creates tsconfig.json file. this basically is indicator for ts that this project, in which this
    file lies and all subfolders of this folder should be managed by typescript. now if you run-
     tsc, 
    then it will compile all ts files that it can find in this project into js files. 
    we can also combine it with watch mode. so run
        tsc --watch or tsc -w

3)Deciding which files are be compiled
    for this thing we have include,exclude and files options in tsconfig.josn. see file.
