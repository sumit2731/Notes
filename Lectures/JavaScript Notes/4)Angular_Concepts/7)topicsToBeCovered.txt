1)for each component that is used in the application Angular compiler generates a factory.
2)When Angular creates a component from a factory,Angular uses this factory to instantiate 
    View Definition which in turn is used to create component View.

4)There is only one instance of a view definition per component type which acts as a template 
    for all views. But for each component instance Angular creates a separate view.
