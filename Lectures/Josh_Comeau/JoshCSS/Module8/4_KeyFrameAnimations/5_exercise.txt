1)here we learn that we can set css varible s in element selector and then we can use those in css animation(in @keyframes) that way
    our animations can be reused.


2)here were animating a hi gesture.
    1)transform does not work on inline elements.
    2)With alternate ease timming function looks a bit weird. because ease is not symetrical timming function. little bit of 
        acceleartion and then lot deacceleration.problem is when we use alternate we not only flipping the animation,like starting
        and ending points, we are also flipping the timming functions.so it has all this deacceleartion, then this accelartion(when it
        turns around other way) and it looks kind of funny.so we changed it to ease-in-out, which is symetrical.

        how we do not having weird stalling at rotate point.
    3)Selecting right rotating point - we saw that which part of image is element. then we seleted a custom origin to imitate waving.
    1)Selecting right angle.
