regarding code of project, each section has its code, but all code repo can be found in "Course Source Code",  there
    we have different branch for diffrent sections and each section we have different codes.


questions -

    multiple state updates in  section 4, lecture 52,58.

questions asked in course -

    1)lecture 54, component getting updated on each form value control change.

JSX syntax -

    1)class -> className
    2)click -> onClick
        all events are listen by 'on' + 'name of event in capital letter'

    3)for -> htmlFor

        html -
            <label for="name">Name</label

        jsx -
            <label htmlFor="name">Name</label>
    
    4)style= "height: 100%"; padding: 20px"  =>  style= {{height: '100px', padding: '20px}}
        so while setting properties like bacjround-color either use -
            
            'background-color' (write property name within '')
            
            or 
            
            bakgroundColor (write js version of proeprtyName i.e camelcase version)

    5)attaching some multiple as well as stateic classes to jsx element -

        <div className = {`staticClass1 ${flag ? 'dynamicClass' : ''} staticClass2 `}></div>

        <div className = {`staticClass1 ${flag && 'dynamicClass'} staticClass2 `}></div>
        

    6)how to render list of elements -

        <div>
            {[<li></li>, <li></li>]}
        </div>

        here react will render all jsx elemnts given in array. so we make this array dynamic based on the list -

        <div>
            {users.map(user => <li></li>)}
        </div>

    7)component communication - listing the state up

    8)ways of conditional renderting
