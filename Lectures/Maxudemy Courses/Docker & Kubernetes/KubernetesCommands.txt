Minicube - sets the dummy cluster locally.it will use a virtual machine oon your machine, to create the cluster in there.So it simulates
    another machine on your machine by using such a virtual machine and the this virtual machine 
    then holds this cluster.It will actually create a single node cluster which means there the worker and master node
    is combined into one single virtual machine

    installation -
        brew install minikube

    commands -
        minikube start - 
            creates the cluster
        minikube dashboard -
            shows the Ui in browser
        minikube status - 
            to check whether cluster is running or not
        minikube delete --all -
            deletes all minibute clusters


kebectrl - It is install on local system , it talks with cluster. it gives commands to master node, which then gets things done by worker
    node.

    installation -
        brew install kubectl

    commands -
        1)kubectl create "objectName" "nameOfObject"
            It creates the mentioned object and sends it to cluster.
            kubectl create - you will get help with types of objects that you can create
            implemententation -
                a)kubectl create deployment "nameOfDeployment"
                    arguments -
                        a)image
                            kubectl creeate deployment "nameOfDeployment" --image="name OfImage"
                                creates a deployment object with a given name and containers in the pod in deployment object will be based
                                on provided image name

        2)kubectl get deployments 
            we can see how many deployments we have in our cluster to which we connected here.

        3)kubectl get pods
            we will see pods created by our deployments.

        4)kubectl delete deployment "nameOfDeployment"
