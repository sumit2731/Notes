Figure 1 Shows the JS engine has call stack and browser has other superpowers like timers, geolocation,localStorage, can communicate with 
    outside world.
Figure 2,shows how JS engine can access these super powers, these are via web api's.Web api's are not part of js engine.we can use all these
    web api's inside call stack. Thease are provided by window object. so we can use window.setTimeout inside call stack.
    so browser wraps up all these window api's inside window object and gives them to js engine.
