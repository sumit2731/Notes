1)The async keyword before a function has two effects:

    a)Makes it always return a promise - async ensures that the function returns a promise, and wraps non-promises in it.We 
        could explicitly return a promise, which would be the same. basically it works in same way how returning from then works.
    b)Allows await to be used in it.

2)The await keyword before a promise makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles, and then:

    a)If promise is rejected(this is as good as throwing the error at that place) — The ppromise returned by async function
        is rejected. thing to be noted it lines in function are skipped but outisde function execution continues as normal.
        we can add catch block to handle the rejection of promise returned by asunc function.
    b)inside asyn function we can use try catch block, now if promise before await fails, this is same as error is thrown
        at that place so control goes to catch block. here we can handle error and then promise returned by async function
        is not rejected.
    c)throwing a error inside async function also means that function execution will be skipped and promise rerturned by
        asyc function will be destroyed.throwing error is only way we can make function returned by async function to be
        rejected.
    d)Otherwise, it returns the result.If the value of the expression following the await operator is not a Promise, it's 
        converted to a resolved Promise.


3)await literally suspends the function execution until the promise settles, and then resumes it with the promise result. 
    That doesn’t cost any CPU resources, because the JavaScript engine can do other jobs in the meantime: execute other scripts, 
    handle events, etc.It’s just a more elegant syntax of getting the promise result than promise.then. And, it’s easier to read 
    and write.

4)to use await in top level code wrap it in annoous function and use async -

    (async () => {
        let response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');
        let user = await response.json();
        ...
    })();

    New feature: starting from V8 engine version 8.9+, top-level await works in modules.

5)await also works with thenable objects.when we use await in front of thenable objects, there then function is called.
    within then when we call call resolve/reject decides when our promise will be resolved and rejected.
