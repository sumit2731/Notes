In grid we define rows and columns. 
    each column should have same rows as next of grid
    each row should have same columns as rest of rows.

Rows/Column and invisible Markers
    Items dnt have to fit perfectly in cell. they can span over more cells.
    Paint parking Example.Rules for valid grid -
        a)In CSS Grid, our element's content box is sliced into rows and columns. 
        
        b)The rows/columns don't have to be the same size, but they do have to be consistent. 
            1)Every cell in the same column needs to have the same width
            2)every cell in the same row needs to have the same height.

        c)We also can't end a row or column prematurely; If our grid has 2 columns and 3 rows,
            each column will have 3 cells.

        d)A grid child can choose to span multiple rows and columns, but it must always produce
            a rectangle. No tetrominoes allowed!


Inset Grids - In Container we can have some dead space that is not used by grid.
