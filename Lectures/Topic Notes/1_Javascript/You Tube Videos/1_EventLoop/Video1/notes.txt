JS Runtime(v8) - Heap(memory allocation) + Callstack (execution context and stack frames)

Browser - JS run time, web api + event loop, callback queue.
    webapi are provided by env in which we are running JS runtime.
    JS run time can only only do one thing at a time.

    callstack - records where in program we are.
