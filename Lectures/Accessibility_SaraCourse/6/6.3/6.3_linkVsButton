button -
    needs javascript to do something
    tabindex=0
    keyboard operable - It firs on enter and space

link -
    if href is present, then this represents the hyperlu=ink. link role is only assigned if href is present.
    if not then then this is not part of accessibility tree.

    link (with href) -
        FOCUSABLE
        fires on enter key only
        right click on it see other option

    how to disable link -
        remove href(now link has no role, so screen readers wnt tell)
        to disable link remove href attribute, add rol="link" and aria-disabled="true" (as there are no disable attribute for link)
        that way screen readers will know that this is dsiabled link


Link vs button -
    Does the element take the user to another page or a section within the page? If the URL changes when the element is clicked,
        then what you want is a link: <a href=".."></a>.
    Does the element change something on the current page (for example: does it change the layout, or open a dialog, or present them with a new view)? If the answer is yes, you probably need a button.
    Can you right-click the element to open it in a new Window? If not, then itâ€™s probably not a link.
    Does the element do anything without JavaScript?

Enhaning link into button

    1)give role="button" to link
    2)Add a click handler.
    3)click handler will be executed on enter, then add a space handler also. because button is fired on space handler also.

    diffrence in space and enter on button -
        1)enter - event is firect on keydown.if you keep pressing key, handlers will be fired multiple time.
        2)space -event is fired on keyup. if you keep presseing key and use tab to move other link, button wnt be fired.

    var btn = document.querySelectorAll('a[role="button"]');

    btn.addEventListener('click', doSomething);

    function doSomething(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert('Chirp chirp!');
    }

    btn.addEventListener("keydown", function(e) {
        // enter key
        if (e.keyCode === 13) {
            doSomething(e);
        }
    });
    btn.addEventListener("keyup", function(e) {
        // space key
        if (e.keyCode === 32) {
            doSomething(e);
        }
    });


Not all assistive technology get information form a11y tree. like  forced color mode. for this you need the style the element.
