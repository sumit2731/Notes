2 legacy Layout modes -
    a)columns


        .wrapper {
            columns: 3;
            column-gap: 16px;
            padding: 16px;
            break-inside: avoid;
        }


    The algorithm's chief concern is distributing content evenly so that all columns are the same height. It's very good 
    at its job; it re-evaluates whenever new content is added, to find the ideal distribution. This obscure layout mode 
    can accomplish things that no other layout mode can.


    b)float
        helps in wrapping text around elements like images.


    c)Indentation
        a)
            p::first-letter {
                margin-left: 2rem;
            }

        b)    
            p {
                text-indent: 2rem;
            }
