171)more Problems with Manual Depooyment

    refer slide 1.

    1)container migt crash and needs to be replaced.
    2)depending upon traffic or workload we might want to increase or decrease the container instances
    3)if we have multiple contianers then we need to distribute incoming traffic equally.

172)Why kubernetes
    slide no 2 & 3

173)What is kubernetes

    refer slide 4
    Kubernetes can help us with the problem outlined in the last lecture because with kubernetes,we have a way of defining our
    deployments,our scaling of containers and how containers should be monitored and replaced if they fail. We have a way of 
    defining all of that independent from the cloud service we're using.

    Because kubernetes is an open-source system and de-facto standard for managing container deployments and for orchestrating 
    containers.

    slide 6 - how kubernetes work.
    slide 7 - confog file
    this configuration would work with any cloud provider as long as it supports Kubernetes, or even if it doesn't support it you
    can manually install some Kubernetes software on any machine you own and then that software, if you want to call it like that,
    we'll be able to utilize this config file.

    And what's even better is the fact that you can actually merge certain cloud providers-specific options into this config file.
    So that if some cloud provider would require additional configuration, you could just add that configuration into that main 
    file And if you then ever want to use that file with another cloud provider,you just need to remove or replace the cloud 
    provider specific configurations with the  new cloud provider,and you don't have to rewrite the entire config file.

    That is the idea behind kubernetes, Having this standardized way of describing deployments.

    slide 8- what kubernetes is not.

    It's an open-source project.It's just a collection of concepts and a collection of software you could say, which together can 
    be used with any cloud provider.

    kubernetes is not just a software which you run on some machine, it's indeed that collection of concepts and tools which you'll
     see in actual throughout this course, which can help us with deployment on any provider of our choice.



     slide 5 - kubernetes is docker-compose for multi-machine setup

     you can think of kubernetes,as Docker-Compose for multiple machines because in its core, that is basically what it's about.
        Docker compose is a tool we learn about,which helps us manage multi container projects easily on our local machine.We could
        even use it on single container projects

    And kubernetes does this the same for multi machine setups because when you deploy your application,you do that by running the
    application across multiple computers, multiple machines,not just one machine.And kubernetes makes deploying your containers,
    monitoring and restarting them automatically across multiple machines very easy.So it's like docker-compose with some convenience
    deployment specific extra features for managing and running your dockerized, your containerized application on a multi machine
    setup
