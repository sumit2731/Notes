problem 3 - it is tricky how to move scroll outside the container.
    we used negative margin to extend child beyond the padding of parent.
    then we introduced padding in child to have that extra sapce.
    now scroll starts from staring of container.

    then we removed the downward padding of parent by using negative margin-bottom on child.

problem 4 - here we added a extra layer.
