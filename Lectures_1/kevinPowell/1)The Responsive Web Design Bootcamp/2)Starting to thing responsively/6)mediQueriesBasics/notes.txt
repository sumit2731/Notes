Media Queries let us add new styles that target only specific conditions. basic syntax is -

@media() {...}

but there are other things that we do need to include here to actually do something. 

first is media type-

@media media-type () {...}

and we can also include media features -

@media media-type and (media-features) {..}

media features are certain things about media type that we are looking at. so we can be very 
    specific about situations that we want to target and put in additional css.

Media type lets us target different types of media.

    1)screen @media screen {...}
    2)print @media print{...}
    3)speech @media speech {...}

Meedia conditions let's target  specific conditions withn that media type
    1)widths @media(min-width: 600px) {}
    2)orinetation @media(orinetation: landscape) {}
    3)specific features @media(hover) {}, 
        you can also look for special features of device like hover. in mobile or tablet you cannot hover.
        so here we you can apply styles will be applied only on thise devices which can hover.

Bothe media type and media conditions are optional. but you either need to have type or condition though.

if we dnt provide media type then by defualt it is all. here we use provide only condition, (like width of viewport) -

    @media (min-wdith: 960px) {}

If you want to combine media type and media consition you have to use and-

@media screen and (min-wdith: 960px) {}. most of times we work with min-width and max-width. we can multiple media queries, in that case order
    is also important. for example-

    body {
        font-size: 1.125rem;
        color: #707070;
        margin: 0;
        background: red
    }

    @media (min-width: 650px) {
        body {
            background: green;
        }
    }

    
    @media (min-width: 400px) {
        body {
            background: blue;
        }
    }

    here green background wnt be applied because after green background we have style with bluw background. when width is larger than 650px
        it means it is also larger than 400px. hence style that is defined later is overwerites the previous one.


we can also combine 2 medi conditions like this-

    @media (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 649px) {
        body {
            background: purple;
        }
    }
now this style will be applied when width is between 400px to 649px.

Then we hve orinetation modes, it can be portrait or landscape. portrait mode is no, when height is greater
than width and landscape mode is on when width is greater than height.


lets see below styles -

    @media(max-width: 500px) {
        .class2 {
            color: blue;
        }
    }

    .class1 {
        color: red
    }


    style in media query wnt be applied because element class selector overrides the color proeprty. so we should define media queries
    after normal selectors.
