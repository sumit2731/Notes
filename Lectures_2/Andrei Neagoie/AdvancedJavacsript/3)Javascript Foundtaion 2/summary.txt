1)In browser global object is window. in nodejs it global.



questions-
1)see code snippet1 , to see question of lexical scope.

10)Hoisting-

    https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-hoisting-in-javascript 
    In second article, it is said- Function declarations are hoisted over variable declarations but not over variable assignments
    see questions on hoisting in first link

11)let vs var vs const

12)In strict mode-
    a)Deleting variables declared with var, let and const gives refrence errors.
    2)we cannot even do write operations on variable that are not defined.
    3)accidental global variables are not allowed
    4)if a fucntion is in global and we call it by its name  then this points to undefined
         not to window object. however if we do not use strict mode then it points to window
         object.
    5)ES 6 modules use - "use strict" by default.

13)Lexical Scope

14)scope chain in js- types of scope- block scope, fucntion scope and global scope

15)IIFE - how it was used in libraries to solve problem of global variables.

16)this in js(questions on what should be value of this)- this has dynamic scope,how this acts as place holder
 see this.js file in code snippets 
    a)how we use call,bind and apply to stabalize the value of this(remove dynamic nature of this).
        1)call, bind and apply
        2)arrow fucntion
        3)storing value in some other variable
        fucntion burrowing and fucntion currying.
        see callAndBind.js in code snippets.

17)scope vs context vs Execution Context
