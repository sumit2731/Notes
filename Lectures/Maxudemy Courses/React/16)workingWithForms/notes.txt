1)here we added a input and its validation logic. see commit, commit1 to see this logic.
2)but that was lot of code to implement a simple think, then we refactored our logic and removed inputValid state and start 
    deriving it from inputValue only.

3)then we started managing formValidity thrugha  separate state and we updated in useEffect hook as it depends upon value of other
    states(inut if all state), but later we started managing form validity in simple variable and updated it during component re-render,
    as we are executing component function on each keystroke in input. see commit2 of code.

4)then we added a one more input- email. see commit - Section 16 part3

5)thne we used hook, there instead of managing value and touched hook in component, we manage them in custom hook.
    commit - section 16 Part 4

6)thn we used that hook to manage 2 input form.

7)then we used that hook to manage 3 input form.



pending -
    1)look into artciles that creates a hook for managing form.
