    Accessing the DOM
    Some libraries that make working with DOM in our test easier

83)Understanding the Problem
    When we try to test code that access DOM, we get the error. One way to get around this problem is to mock the DOM object.
    but it is complicated function and mocking all that might be tricky.

    Now because it's such a common problem that you have tests for browser site JavaScript code and you therefore want to be
    able to interact with the DOM for example, both Vitest and just support the DOM virtually so to say out of the box.


84) working with different testing envirenment

    here we chnaged the testing envirement from node to happy-dom.(jest supports the jsdom).there are various ways to do that in vitest -
        a)add a flag in cmd command, that is what we did here - 
             "test": "vitest --run --environment happy-dom"
        b)Add comments in tests file -
            @jest-envirement jsdom

    ways to do that in jest -
        a)install jsdom npm package
        b)configure jest to use JSDOM -
            In jest.config.js set testEnvironment -
                module.exports = {
                    testEnvironment: 'jsdom'
                };
            
        c)instead of b use, comments in js file
    see lecture for details.

    our test in dom.test.js is still failing because it is not able to find a element in DOM.

85)Setting up Virtual HTML Page
    See dom.test.js, here we loaded ur html file in our virtual DOM envirement.

    steps for doing similar thing in jest is also given in question.


86)Testing DOM Functionalities

    see second test in dom.test.js. here we tested that a p tag is created by element in document.

87)DOM tests and cleanup work
