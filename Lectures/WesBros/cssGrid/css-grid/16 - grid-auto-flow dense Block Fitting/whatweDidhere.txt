Here we understood why we can have gaps in grid.Gaps can come because- 
    1)lets say we have 10 columns, but to 6th column we said it should start at 1st columns.
     now items after 6th columns can fit in those empty spaces but they will start after 6th 
     column. so we will have empty spaces.
    2)lest say 6th column needs 6 spots to fill but we only have 5 spots left in row. so it 
     leaves those 5 spots empty and moves 6th item to next row. items that come after 6th 
     item are then placed after 6th item. so we have 5 empty spots in first row. 
     
     
     
Then we saw how we can fill these spaces, this by using-
        grid-auto-flow: dense
    what this option does is, now new item will not come after item 6,
    first they will fill any empty left by item6.
    now lets say 7th item needs 10 columns, so it cannot fit in columns left by 6th item in row 1,
    nor it can fit in same row as 6th item, we need separate row for it. but 8th item will go back
    to fill up spaces left by  6th item. so it makes sure we do not have any empty spaces.

    grid-autoflow : dense works like this, first we place the item whose position we have set up
    explicitly, then we will try to fill in hole with items whose position we have not defined. it tries 
    to fill these new items in space left by some item, if item can fit there, then it will place that item there.
    note that even after uisng this property, there may be some situations where we stll have gaps,
    we will see it in gallery exmaple. this will be cases when we have space for one column, but
    we do not have any item that can fit in 1 column, i.e all items need 2 column span.
    here we dnt have any space, because we have lot of items that can fit in single column.
