here we saw how we can have 3 equal size columns. first approach is to do width:33.33%%, problem with this is if we have only 2 
    items then empty space is left out. so better way is to set width:100%, now no matter how many columns are there they all
    be equal sized. this is because each of them wants 100% but as flex-shrink is 1 for all of them , they shrink in equal
    proportion.


default value of width is 'auto', so there width depends upon content in item, but shrink ration was same. hence size of diffrent
    as it depends upon content.
