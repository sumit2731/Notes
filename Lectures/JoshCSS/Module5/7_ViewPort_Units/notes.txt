Then mobile vh problem and solutions.
    a)use a js based unit (not reccommended)
    b)use percentages to pass height from html and body.
    c)have a design such that centering is not required

Dynamic viewport units (In Mobile)
    
    svh — Small Viewport Height
    lvh — Large Viewport Height
    dvh — Dynamic Viewport Height

    they are avalible for 86 percent users. for 14% users, we can add a fallback -

        .some-element {
            height: 100vh; /* Fallback for legacy users */
            height: 100dvh;
        }
