/**
 * IDE Superpowers
 *
 *
 * 40 - hovering over different paths in nested object notationa.b.c.d
 *
 * 42 - ts doc comments - @example
 *
 * 45 - TS tries to show error at right place. In case of function it shows the error at function level.
 *   because when you compare functions, you need to compare them as a whole.
 *
 * 47 - rename symbol explained, this also works across the files.
 *
 * 46 - cmd+click (go to definition)
 *  where function is used - takes to definition
 *  where it is defined - shows all places where this fucntion is refrenced
 *
 * 48 - adding missing import
 *     a)get sugesstions by autocomplete, move to end of line and press ctrl + space.
 *     b)open quick fixes by moving to error and pressing - "cmd + .", from there select all missing imports.
 *
 *
 * 49 - "organize imports", prune imports that are not used.
 *
 * 50 - in quick fixes, we have options like, refactor to expression, refactor to function etc.
 *  which helps us to move code to new function, or to create constant from expression
 *
 *
 * 51 - how to set up prettier -
 *  a)in packages.json - prettier should be there
 *  b)install prettier extension
