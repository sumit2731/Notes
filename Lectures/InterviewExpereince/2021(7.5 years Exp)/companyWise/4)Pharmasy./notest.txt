Round 1 -

    1)Write a program to check if strings are matching in a string
        
        solution in app.js

        I solved it.
        questions by interveiwer-

            1)any other way to solve it?
            2)why use extra space in  object, use map instead.

    2) -

        1)Write a program to check if rotation number in cyclic srted array.

        I solved in in O(n), interviewer asked to solve it on O LOg(n). I was not able to. interveiwer gave hints like
            use binary search, then even said ki compare last number and all but i was not able to. see correct solution
            in app2.js.

        solution was easy, you just need to make all patterns in copy .write it down in copy.
