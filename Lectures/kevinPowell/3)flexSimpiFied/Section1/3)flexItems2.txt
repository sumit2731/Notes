here we saw our default size of flex items depends upon content in them. they are just as wide as it is needed to it their 
    content.epty space is left blank.if the size of one item is very large, so that all items cannot fit into container, 
    then items shrink to just inside container.item shrinks in such a way that min-width for each item is maintained. for 
    text it is size of longest word, for image it can be width of image.


this is default behaviour of flex-items which can be tweaked if we want to.
