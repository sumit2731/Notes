initial -
    initial value of div is inline
    Tying all this back to initial, we can see that the value of initial is great to use if you 
        really want to remove all browser specific styles.

inherit -

unset - initial or inherit.
    inherited properties - inherit
    rest - initial

    used with 'all'.The all property allows you to set one value for every single property of an
        element. This is really useful if you want to remove all browser specific styles from an
        element such as a button.

        .btn-all {
            all: unset;
        }

        .btn-no-all {
            background: initial;
            border: initial;
            font-size: inherit;
            font-family: inherit;
        }


revert - allows you to reset a CSS value back to the browser specific style.this could be useful
    to change back some styles to their browser specific style after doing a all: unset.
