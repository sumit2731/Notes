Creational design patterns
    These patterns are used to provide a mechanism for creating objects in a specific situation without revealing the creation
     method. The normal approach for creating an object might lead to complexities in the design of a project. These patterns 
     allow flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a specific use case by providing control over the 
     creation process.


Structural Design Patterns
    These patterns concern class/object composition and relationships between objects. They let you add new functionalities to
     objects so that restructuring some parts of the system does not affect the rest. Hence, when some parts of structure 
     change, the entire system does not need to change.


Behaviour Design patterns
    These patterns are concerned with communication between dissimilar objects in a system. They streamline the communication
     and make sure the information is synchronized between such objects.


Architectural design patterns#
    These patterns are used for solving architectural problems within a given context in software architecture.
