While generating the DOM, browsers automatically process errors in the document, close tags and so on.



there’s a rule – if something’s in HTML, then it also must be in the DOM tree. so even comments are part of DOM.

Even the <!DOCTYPE...> directive at the very beginning of HTML is also a DOM node. It’s in the DOM tree right before <html>.


There are 12 node types. In practice we usually work with 4 of them:

    document – the “entry point” into DOM.
    element nodes – HTML-tags, the tree building blocks.
    text nodes – contain text.
    comments – sometimes we can put information there, it won’t be shown, but JS can read it from the DOM
