This file tells compiler how should it compile our files into js.

we have compilerOptions where we can configure how the compiler behaves. before that lets see some of
options which don't affect the compiler or compulation step but instead how the compiler works with
this project. open tsconfig.json, after compilerOptions add include,exclude and files options.
see comments in these section for notes. so that we have manually added these options, they where
not there by default.

Now lets dive into compilerOptions.here we see lot of options in tsconfig.json. we can ignoe most of options,
because we will rarely used them. we will look at important ones, throughout this course , because some configs
 makes sensse when we learn about certain features.I want to dive into some of the options though-
    1)target - it tells the js version to which code will be compiled. by default
     its value is es5. if we remove this proeprty then default value is es3.
     es6 is es2015. press ctrl +space to get IDE sugesstions. vs code
     will give you ide suggestions.
     in some cases we want tsc compiler to make sure our code works in old
     browser but some times we have some build tools that will take of js translation
     so we dnt need to do this by ts compiler.
     note that more modern your target version is, lesser will be code in
     translated js files.

     2)modules- I will skip this options, becaus eit will make sense only when we are are
     aware about module sin typescript and how w ecan connect multiple files.

     3)libs - see lecture 37 for rest of configurations see code.
