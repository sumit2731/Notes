Every java project will have src folder which contains your code in package format.

In notepad -
    javac helloWorld.java (generates the complied machine code in same folder - helloWorld.class)
    java  helloWorld (here it runs the helloWorld.class generated in first step)

    These 2 steps can be combined into single one  -

    javac helloWorld.java
