How client and Server Interact with each other - TCP(TRANSMISSION Control Protocol)
    Information is sent via packets. packet is samll piece of data, which is part of bigger information.smalle packets can be combined to
    send bigger piece of data.

    Steps in connection

        a)connection initiation - 3 way commnucation
            synchronization packet
            synchronizaton-acknowledgement packet - it;'s own synchronization + acknowledgement of getting syn packet
            acknowledgement packet - acknowledgement that it got synchronization packet form other side

        b)exchanging messages -now 2 computers are connected to each other via TCP and can start sending message back and forth usually
            http messages.
        c)connection termination - when user moves away form website one side sends fin message and other side sends acknowledgement.
            this ends the connection from one side. same things needs to happen to end connection from other side also.

            so technically you can have a TCP connection still open, where only one side of the connection is still able 
            to send messages across the connection,but usually they are both closed out at the same time,so the connection
            is completely terminated.
