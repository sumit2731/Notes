Algorithm -
    here we place smallest item in sorted position one at time. we are moving from begining
    to end. but sorted data is accumulated from begining. we compare first value with every
    other value in array and the we placed smallest in begining.so at the end of loop smallest element
    is at begining. similarly we proceed till second last element.

Time Coplexity - O(n*n)
    i know in first loop loop we make n itemartions in second we make n-1. but that does'nt matter
    in grand scheme of things we are still going with O(n*n).

    selection sort is better than bubble sort if you want to minimize the swaps that you are making. which is
    not the case most of times.
