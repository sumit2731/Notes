flex is combination of three properties -

    1)flex-basis - beofer egrowing and shrinking, how big each item should be(along main axis) - default value is auto. which means 
        accoridng to its content.
    2)flex-grow - It means in which proprotion should i grow as compared to others when there is extra space.
    3)flex-shrink - It means how much of myself should i give up in proportion to other one's.

What's diffrence between flex-basis and width(or height)-

    Go these this blogs -
        1)https://mastery.games/post/the-difference-between-width-and-flex-basis/
        2)https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/flexboxs-flex-basis-explained-83d1a01413b7/
            Main Ponts of second blog-
            a)Flex-basis controls either “width” or “height” based on the flex-direction.
            b)Flex-basis in a column overrides height:, this is important because although width: will obey flex-shrink, 
                height: will not. to proove this point see code in flder,flex-basis-code. in code we can see that when we
                give height
