The browser does something called selector machting which means that each set of styles will be matched against all nodes
    (elements) on the page.

The browser starts with the most general rule applicable to a node (e.g: if a node it's the child of the body element, then 
all body styles are inherited by that node) and then recursively refines the computed styles by applying more specific rules.
This is why we say that the style rules are cascading.
