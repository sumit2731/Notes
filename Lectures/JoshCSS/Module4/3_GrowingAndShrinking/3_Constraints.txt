In flex-grow,flex-shrink,flex-basis all respect min-width/max-width, min-height/max-height.

In Main Axis we set the hypothetical width, height. actualu height depends on flex-grow, flex-shrink and container size. but it will
    constraint by min-width/max-width.

In Cross axis we set align-items is stretch but a height is given then that height will be respected. similarly min/max-height is
    also respected.


Exercise 1 -

    here again wanted one column to be 1/3rd of total width. so used flex-basis:0 trick. to solve it. also we gave max-width to both
        columns.

Exercise 2 -
    This is important exercise. see it.
