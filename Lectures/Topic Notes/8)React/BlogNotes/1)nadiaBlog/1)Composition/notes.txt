1)size, that allows reading it without scrolling
2)when extracting smaller components, don’t stop halfway. A component should be described either as a “component that implements 
    various stuff” or as a “component that composes various components together”, not both.

3)extract Container components when there is a need to share some visual or behavioural logic that wraps elements that still need to 
    be under “consumer” control.

    there will be performnace boost if we can pass other component as childern. they do not render when component re renders.

4)Does this state belong to this component?

Good Component Rules -

    a)A “good component” is a component that I can easily read and understand what it does from the first glance.
    b)A “good component” should have a good self-describing name.
        Sidebar for a component that renders sidebar is a good name. 
        CreateIssue for a component that handles issue creation is a good name. 
        SidebarController for a component that renders sidebar items specific for “Issues” page is not a good name (the name indicates 
            that the component is of some generic purpose, not specific to a particular page).
    c)A “good component” doesn’t do things that are irrelevant to its declared purpose.
        Topbar component that only renders items in the top bar and controls only topbar behaviour is a good component. 
        Sidebar component, that controls the state of various modal dialogs is not the best component.
