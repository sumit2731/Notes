we have some some sort of structure ,liner structures and we are going to be(i dnt knw) seraching for  pair of values or 
    seraching for something that meets a condition, usually we are searching for a pair.we use 2 refrences, one at the 
    start and other at the end and we move them towards each other towards middle. or we can have both of them at start 
    and move them forward in certai way, so there is there is no guarnteed direction.

    In first example we have one pointer at start and one and one at end and move towards each other.
    In Second Example both pointers are at starting and both move in same direction.
