1)pixel
2)em - The em unit is an interesting fellow. It's a relative unit, equal to the font size of the current element.
3)rem - it is relative to font size of root element i.e <html> tag.it respects user preferences when it comes to increasing/decreasing 
    default font sizes.you shouldn't actually set a px font size on the html tag. This will override a user's chosen default font size.
    If you really want to change the baseline font size for rem units, you can do that using percentages:

    html {
        /* 20% bigger `rem` values, app-wide! */
        font-size: 120%;
    }

    Which unit to use for what -

        How to decide -"Should this value scale up as the user increases their browser's default font size?"

        when to use rem -
            
            font-size - use rem, so that it can scale when user increases the zoom size of machine or when user increases 
                the default font-size in browser settings.
            
            media-queries -
                
                @media (min-width: 50rem) {
                
                }

                this is because as font-size increases min-width should also increase. so it means to switch to desktop
                size we need more width, this is what we require.

                We're so used to thinking of media queries in terms of mobile/tablet/desktop, but I think it's more helpful to think
                in terms of available space.A mobile user has less available space than a desktop user, and so we design layouts that
                are optimized for that amount of space. Similarly, when someone cranks up their default font size, they reduce the 
                amount of available space, and so they should probably receive the same optimizations.

            
            vertical margin - use rem, because it makes sense to compound these with increasing the font-size by user.even better
                we can use em units.
            
            width -  it depends on the circumstances!
                
                if we use rem, then increasing size of text will also cause increase in width.which will prevent line brekage and
                overflow of text
                
                line breakage and increase height of container, if we
                do not use rem's.

        when to use pixel -
            padding
            border
            width - In some cases, though, pixels might be the better option. Maybe if you have a very specific layout in mind,
            and vertical space is more plentiful than horizontal space.

        when to use em -
            useage of em's - top and bottom margin of headings and paragraph. see article.
