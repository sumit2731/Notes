Fluid Design

    In the last lesson,we saw how we have two choices when it comes to scaling text based on the viewport:

        1)We can define specific sizes at specific breakpoints using media queries (“responsive”).
        2)We can proportionally grow/shrink text based on the viewport width using the vw unit (“fluid”).
        
    Here are the two strategies side-by-side.
