here we applied media query to chnage  flex-direction and width of cols. note that we have used media
    query selector 2 times , like this-

    @media (max-width: 600px) {
        .columns {
            flex-direction: column;
        }
    }

    @media (max-width: 600px) {
        .col-1, .col-2, .col-3 {
            width: 100%;
        }
    }

    one approach is to group these all under one selector and define them at end of stylesheet like this-

        @media (max-width: 600px) {
            
            .columns {
                flex-direction: column;
            }

            .col-1, .col-2, .col-3 {
                width: 100%;
            }
        }

    but kevins follows first approach, he defines a selector and just below that selecor kevin defines the media
        query version of that selector. it help us to manage cod in better way. also there is a some test done on,
        when you are repeating yourself a lot with media queries, how big is impact and it's really not that bad.
