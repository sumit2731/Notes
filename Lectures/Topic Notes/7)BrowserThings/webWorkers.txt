creating web worker -
    const worker = new Worker("<worker_file>.js");

communication -
    a)post message -
        In main script-
            sending-
                worker.postMessage('Hello Worker'); 
            listening messages form main thread -
                worker.onmessage = function(message)

        In worker script -
            listening -
                self.onmessage = function(message){}
            sending -
                self.postMessage(sum);

    b)broadcast API -
        Broadcast Channel, also known as the Broadcast Channel API, allows basic communication between browsing contexts 
            (like windows, frames, tabs, or iframes)
        
        const bc = new BroadcastChannel('newChannel'); 
        bc.postMessage('Message is sent through a broadcast channel'); 
        bc.onmessage = (event)=>{ console.log(event);}
        bc.close(); 




NOTE: A thread is created once a Worker call is initiated. This thread only communicates with its creator, that is the file 
    which created this thread.
