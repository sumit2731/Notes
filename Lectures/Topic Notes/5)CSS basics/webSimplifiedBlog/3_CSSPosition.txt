Static -
    a)Default
    b)cannot have the z-index, top, left, right, or bottom properties applied to them.

relative -
    a)relative positioned elements also follow the normal document flow
    b)you can offset them using the top, left, right, and bottom properties.
    c)you can also apply z-index property
    d)The main use cases for position relative are to either set the z-index of the element, or
        to be used as a container for absolute positioned elements.

absolute - 
    a)completely removes the element from the normal document flow.other elements will act as if
        the absolute positioned element doesnâ€™t even exist.
    b)absolute positioned elements have their width defaulted to auto instead of being full
        width like a div.
    c)by default an absolute positioned element will place itself in the document where it 
        normally would have rendered if it was a static element, but we can change that with the
        top, left, right, and bottom properties.

    d)by default a position absolute element will position itself relative to the body. You can
        change the element that the absolute positioned element is positioned off of by setting
        the position of one of its parent elements to anything other than static. This is one of
        the most common places relative position is used.

fixed -
    a)it removes the element from the document flow.
    b)elements are always positioned relative to the screen no matter what position its parent
        elements are.

sticky -
    a)combination of both fixed and static
    b)act like a static positioned element until the page scrolls to a point where the element 
        hits the top, left, right, or bottom value specified.It will then act like a fixed
        position element and scroll with the page until the element gets to the end of its
        container.

Absolute/Fixed Position Advanced -
    transform, filter, or perspective
