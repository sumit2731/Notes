order - It is proeprty we apply on flex items.It takes integars as a value without any unit etc.
    default order when we dnt set it is 0. if we set order reater than 0, our item come last in main axis.
    for value smaller than 0, it will move to begining of main axis.

This is cool because we can chnage the order of elements in css. sometimes when we move to mobile layout we 
    need to chnage order. using it we can do it just by applying some class.


there is a limitation, that while selecting text, next item in DOM will be selected.
