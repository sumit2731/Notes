3)we can more tighter inference by TS by tighting the constraints. see comments on
    solution

9)here we saw that we can accept generics into function and we can pass them to another type
    helper.

12)You can represent the generic at different levels. and generally it is ggod idea to define genric
    ar lower level and pick what we excatly want.

1)in order to put constraint on generic that is of type - string| number |symbol
    use "keyof any"
