    button:disabled {}
    button:disabled:hover {}

2):first-of-type
    <article>
        <h1>A Title</h1>
        <p>Paragraph 1.</p>
        <p>Paragraph 2.</p>
        <p>Paragraph 3.</p>
    </article>

    to select first p -
        p:first-of-type {
            font-size: 1.25em;
    }

    The :first-of-type selector in CSS allows you to target the first occurance of an element within its container.
    Using :first-of-type is very similar to :nth-child but with one critical difference: it is less specific. 
    In the example above, if we had used p:nth-child(1), nothing would happen because the paragraph is
    not the first child of its parent 
    (the <article>).

    This reveals the power of :first-of-type: it targets a particular type of element in a particular 
        arrangement with relation to similar siblings, not all siblings.
    


3):nth-of-type() - from elements that matches the given selector, it selects elements based on params passed

    li {
        background: slategrey;
    }
    
    /* select alternating items starting with the second item */
    
    li:nth-of-type(2n) {
        background: lightslategrey;
    }

    arguments - 
        single integer - If an integer is specified only one element is selected
        the keywords “even” or “odd”, 
        or a formula as shown above - an + b

    :nth-of-type(3n) {
        // from given elements it selects every 3rd element.
    }

    trick - 
        selecting only first 3.

        p:nth-of-type(-n +3) {}

4):nth-last-of-type - 
    similar to above but iteration starts from last element.

5)last-of-type 
    selects the last occurance of element with provided selector in its container
6):first-child
    The :first-child selector allows you to target the first element immediately inside another element.

    selects the element with given selector which is also first child of its parent.
    
    li:first-child {
        color: red;
    }

    The :first-child selector allows you to target the first element immediately inside another element.
        p:first-child is looking for situations where a paragraph is the first child within a parent container

    selector:first-child {}
        element which matches this selector, but that element should be first child of its parent.

    selector >*:first-child {}
        Apply this style to first child of element selected by selector.

7):nth-child()

    see css trick
    
    :nth-child(3n) - Selects every third element among any group of siblings
    li:nth-child(3) - Selects the second li element in a list
    div:nth-child(3)Selects the second element of div siblings

8):nth-last-child()
    It functions the same as :nth-child except it selects items starting at the bottom of the source
    order, not the top.

9):not - used to exclude aa element from selection
