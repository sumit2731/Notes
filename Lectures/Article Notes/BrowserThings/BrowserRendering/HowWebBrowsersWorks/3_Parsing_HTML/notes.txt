how Harsing of html starts. harsing is done by browser engine. diffrent browser engines -
    chrome - blink
    safari - webkit

Even if the request page's HTML is larger than the initial 14KB packet, the browser will begin parsing and attempting to 
    render an experience based on the data it has.


first bytes are converted into characters using character encoding specified in html.
then bytes are convered into tokens.
tokens are converted into nodes.
the node into DOM Tree.


 When the parser will encounter non-blocking resources (for example images), the browser will request those images from the
 server and continue parsing. On the other hand, if it encounters blocking-resources (CSS stylesheets, Javascrpt files added
 in the <head> section of the HTML or fonts added from a CDN ), the parser will stop execution until all those blocking
 resources are downloaded.
