Logical properties are simply a way to specify the size, margin, padding, etc. using the logical
    flow of the container (start, end) instead of the actual directions of the page (top, 
    bottom, left, right). Essentially any property you see that refers to a specific direction 
    (width, top, padding-left) has a new corresponding logical property to set that value
    instead (inline-size, inset-block-start, padding-inline-start).



    width => inline-size
    height => block-size
    margin-top => margin-block-start
    oyerflow-y - overflow-block

    top => inset-block-start (Some cases like top require you to add an additional word to the property to make it clear what the property does.)
    padding-left => padding-inline-start
    border-top => border-block-start


Additonal Support -
    One really nice feature that logical properties have is that you can now easily set the 
        margin/padding for one axis at the same time.


        .old {
            /* No way to do this shorthand */
            margin-top: 1rem;
            margin-bottom: 1rem;
        }

        .new {
            margin-block: 1rem;
        }


Browser Support - good


    .class {
        width: 200px;
    }

    @supports (inline-size: 200px;) {
        .class {
            width: initial;
            inline-size: 200px;
        }
    }
