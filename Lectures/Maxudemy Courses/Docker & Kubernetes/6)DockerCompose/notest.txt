    the Docker ecosystem, ships with a naval tool,which is called, Docker Compose,which makes managing multi containers
    setups easier,it helps you automate the setup process and it allows you to bring up this entire setup, with all the
    different containers and their individual configurations with just one command.

    in this section we will see, how we can utilize Docker Compose to make working with this multi container application
    a bit more convenient and easier.


92)Docker-Compose:What & Why?
    see slide 2.
    
    Docker Compose is not suited for managing multiple containers on different hosts.At least that's not its primary 
    strength.Docker Compose is really great for managing multiple containers on one and the same host.

    Docker Compose is perfect and in general,it's a super powerful Docker tool, which you will use a lot in reality for
    development, but also for things beyond development, as you will learn throughout this course.

    see slide 3

    it shows what goes in docker file. idea of compose is replace the running docker commands in terminal with a 
    configuration file.
