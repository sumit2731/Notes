    flex-basis

    order - default value for all flex-child is 1. child with greater value of order will appear 
        later in flexbox.

    flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis; (note second and third values are optional, but even using flex property sets the 
        flex-basis to 0%)


        when we set a single value for flex -

        flex: 1 => flex-grow: 1, flex-basis: default value(which is 1), flex:basis (0)

        flex: 1 2 => flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 2, flex-basis: 0%
