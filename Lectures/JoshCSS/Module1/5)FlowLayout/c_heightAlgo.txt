The default "width" behaviour of a block-level element is to fill all the available width, whereas the default "height" 
behaviour is to be as small as possible while fitting all of the element's content; it's closer to width: min-content 
than width: auto!

An element's width is calculated based on its parent's size, but an element's height is calculated based on its children.

We generally want to avoid setting fixed heights.

common problem where percentage based height do not work.

giving 100% height to html means 100vh.

vh height issues in mobiles and why it is better to use 100% on body.
