Or it's currently at this point 20% of our resulting bundle that we don't need immediately. So it would be great if we could use the same technique, create a loadable NoteView. Then go to the NoteView container and swap out NoteView for the loadable NoteView. And then we'll come back together and we'll be able to reanalyze it.

I'm gonna make a branch on this called live coding. I'm gonna push out what I have right now so you can pull it down. If you didn't like yarn install or mpm install, you can have those dependencies. You can take it for a spin and see how it goes, and then we'll do it together in about 20 minutes.
