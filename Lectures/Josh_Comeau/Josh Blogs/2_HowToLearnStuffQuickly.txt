a)2 types of learning -
    Guided learning
    Unguided Learning

b)Making Intentional Mistakes - In tutorial play around with code
    Tutorial fade

c)Extending Tutorials

d)Building related projects - I've seen this strategy described as "one on, one off". Follow
    a guided resource like a tutorial, and then spend an equal amount of time creating a 
    similar (but unguided) project. If the tutorial shows you how to build an Instagram 
    clone, try building a Twitter clone on your own!

    If you really can't crack it, you can set this project aside for now. Do a few more 
        tutorials, and then check back later to see if you've learned enough to unblock
        yourself.

    Finding Right Balance - More guided learning initially, later more unguided learning.

e)MindSet Cultivation - If you think that your level of bowling skill is fixed, it will be.
    If you believe that you can improve, you will!*


f)Goals and Motivations - helps when things do not go your way

g)Remembering Things -

h)Building a daily habit - learn daily than 7 hours in a day

I)learning in public - write blog, make video or document it.
    a)It uncover flaws/holes in your mental model
    b)you can refrence it later for your self
    c)you connect with community, helps in job finding/enter

    Start with publishing on dev before building something complicated.

h)A network of Skills
