1)when we mock functions in file, we need to give type to these functions especially when we spy 
    these and want to mock a return value.

    const mockedGetCommandDefinitionsAction = jest.spyOn(
        CommandActions,
        'getCommandDefinitionsAction'
    ) as unknown as jest.Mocked<() => { type: string }>;


    file DeviceLogs.test.tsx


2)fake timers -
    DeviceLogs.tes.tsx
