1)syntax to define generator function.
2)geneator function returns a generator object which is iterator object-
    how to use generator function  in loop to get values, 
    use generator function to create array.

3)We can use a generator function for iteration by providing it as Symbol.iterator. generator function returns a iterable,
    which is excactly what a Symbol.iterator should return. Generators were added to JavaScript language with iterators in mind, 
    to implement them easily.

4)Generator composition -

    Generator composition is a special feature of generators that allows to transparently “embed” generators in each other.

5)“yield” is a two-way street -
    it not only returns the result to the outside, but also can pass the value inside the generator.
