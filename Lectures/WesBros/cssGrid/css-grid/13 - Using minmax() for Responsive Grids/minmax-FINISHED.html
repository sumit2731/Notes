      *Here 1st and last column will have fix width of 400px. but column in middle can have width between
       100px and 500px. actual size depends on screen width. note that if do not have enough screen size to
       give 1st a nd third column, width of 400px, then columns will ,move out from container, if screen width
       is not enough, then we will have scroll bar. in same way 2nd column cannot go less than 200px, if 
       screen size is enough we will have scroll bar. but if we have sapce then 2nd column can go anywhere 
       between 100px to 400px

      /* 2
      *least width without scrollbar(lets say this is pont1) will be when 1st,3rd and 4th column should have width, 
       which is just enough to contain their content.lets say now, content of fourth column is
       very wider, now only fourth column will be wider, rest 1st and 3rd columns will have width
       according to their content. 2nd column will have width of 100px. if we further decrease screen
       width then we will have scroll bar.
       
       we start incerasing width from point1, then width of second column will keep on increasing untill
       it reaches 500px. before it reaches 500px width of other columns will not increase. this is because
       fr means free units and free units are calculated after we have allocated width to all avalible columns,
       but second columns is still accepting width, so fr columns will be only wide as they need to be. after
       2nd columns recahes 500px, other columns will start expnading it. because now we have free units.

       this is how fr units work, it has nothing to do with minmax

       less than that will lead to scroll bar. lets name this point as point 1.
       As we increase width, all coluns will increase their width, till they reach maximum width. note that they will
       increase in width proportionally(they will). even if one of column has maximum width of 1000px instead of

      increasing screen size, the fr size will keep on increasing but column1 will have width of 300px,

        it will work like this- it will start with 150px columns, lets say we can have 4 columns of 150px
        on screen. there is no place for 5th columns. but we have some space left after 4 columns, then it
        will divide that space between 4 columns. 
        
        but as increase width, the width of columns will keep on increasing, but when width is enough to
        accomodate new column then width of exisiting columns will decrease and we wil have oen more
        column. it is responsive now. maxiumm width is fr, which is decided dynamically after we
        put all columns. it means they can be entire width of cotianer
