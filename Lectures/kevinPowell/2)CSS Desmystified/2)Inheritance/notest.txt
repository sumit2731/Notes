Not everything is inheritant but there is rule of thumb.Anything related to typography is inherired-
    font-size
    font-family
    text-decoration
    color
    font-weight
    line-height
i.e is the rreason we place lot of typography rules on html or body.
browser styles takes precendence over inherited styles i.e inherited styles have least precedence.

Nothing related to layout is inherited, like -
    margin
    padding
    height
    width
    position

If you really want inherited values for some properties from parent, assign inherit value to that property.

    a {
        color: inherited;
    }

Some times some elements (button, text, select) have some browser defualts so that they do not inherit typography related 
    things(browser defaults overwrites inheritance). but we want inheritance t take place, so in that case use inheritance 
    value -
        button,
        input,
        select,
        textarea {
            font-size: inherit;
        }
