Things needed for testing -

    See figure 1
    a)Test runner
        eg - Jest,Karma
    b)Assertion Library
        eg -Jest,Chai

JEST vs VITEST -
    We will use VITEST in this course because -
        a)JEST can be slow.
        b)ESModules- Jest kind of supports it.It does support ECMAScript modules but support is only experimental.
            And in my experience, setting it up and making it work with this other import Syntex can be very annoying
            and you often end up installing extra tools and you set up an extra workflow for testing where the code gets
            transpiled and changed behind the scenes, which is always a bit annoying if your main code works just like that
            without any extra setup and you then need some extra configuration just to make your tests work.That's not really
            the idea behind testing.You don't wanna test something different than you run in production,even though it's just
            a behind the scenes transpolation.

    Vitest is both a test runner and an assertion library.

Installing Vitest -

    a)npm install --save-dev vitest

    b)add a script in package.json -
        "scripts" : {
            "test": "vitest --globals"
        }

        globals flags lets you use things like 'it' and 'expect' without any imports.
