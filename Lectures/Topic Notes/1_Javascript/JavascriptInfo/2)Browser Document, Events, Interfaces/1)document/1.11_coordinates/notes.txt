2 types of corrdinate system -
    a)relatve to window(change on scroll) - clientX,clientY
    b)relative to document - pageX, pageY


relative to window -

    getBoundingClientRect (relative to window) -

        Main DOMRect properties:

            x(not supported by IE) -
            y (not upported by IE)-
            width -
            height -
            left/right -
            top/bottom -

            Coordinates may be negative. For instance, if the page is scrolled so that elem is now above the window, then 
                elem.getBoundingClientRect().top is negative.

            This can be used for fixed positioning a element directly below some other element. but when we scroll then
                given element scrolls with document but fixed elements remains there.



    elementFormPoint(x,y) - 
        document.elementFromPoint(x, y) returns the most nested element at window coordinates (x, y).

        he method document.elementFromPoint(x,y) only works if (x,y) are inside the visible area.
        If any of the coordinates is negative or exceeds the window width/height, then it returns null.


relative to document -

    There is no direct way of finding the position of element with respect to document. but we can find these using these -

        element.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.pageYOffset
        element.getBoundingClientRect().left + window.pageXOffset

    using this coordinates we can position a element using position: absolute. and it will come directly below element.
    even on scroll it will scroll with the element.
