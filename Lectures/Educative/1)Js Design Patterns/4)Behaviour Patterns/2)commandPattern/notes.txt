Command Pattern -
    The command pattern allows encapsulation of the requests or operations into separate objects. It decouples the 
    objects that send requests from the objects responsible for executing those requests.

    Consider an example where the client is accessing the methods of an API directly throughout the application. 
    What will happen if the implementation of that API changes? The change will have to be made everywhere the API 
    is being used. To avoid this, we could make use of abstraction and separate the objects requesting from those 
    implementing the request. Now, if a change occurs, only the object making the call will need to change.



When to use command Pattern -

    You can use it if you want to:

        queue and execute requests at different times

        perform operations such as reset or undo

        keep a history of requests made
