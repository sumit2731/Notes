box-sizing: content-box or border-box

default - 

    *,
    *::before,
    *::after {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

Why the pseudo-elements?
    You might be wondering: why do we need to add *::before and *::after? Shouldn't the wildcard selector (*) select 
    everything?

    Well, yes and no. The * selector will select all elements, but ::before and ::after aren't considered elements.
    They're pseudo-elements. And so we need to select them explicitly.
