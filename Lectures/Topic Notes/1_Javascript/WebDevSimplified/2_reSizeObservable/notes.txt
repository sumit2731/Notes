Reason for change in size -
    window size changing
    elements being added/removed from the page
    user interaction, and much more.



Properties on entries -
    contentRect(DOMRectReadOnly) - contains information such as the width, height, top, left, bottom, right,
        etc. of our element
    target - gets the current element, you can for example change the size of element
    borderBoxSize,contentBoxSize, devicePixelContentBoxSize - ach of these properties will be an array
        that will almost always contain just one value which is an object with a blockSize and 
        inlineSize property


ResizeObservableOptions -
    box -
        content-box(default) -
        border-box - takes into account things like border and padding changes
        device-pixel-content-box - The device-pixel-content-box is similar to the content-box
            option but it takes into account the actual pixel size of the device it is rendering
            too. This means that the device-pixel-content-box will change at a different rate than
            the content-box depending on the pixel density of the device.


Methods on Observer -
    unobserve - method takes a single element as its only parameter and it stops observing that single 
        element.
    disconnect - takes no parameters and will stop observing all elements.


Code -
    const observer = new ResizeObserver(entries => {
        entries.forEach(entry => {
            console.log(entry.borderBoxSize[0].blockSize)
            console.log(entry.contentBoxSize[0].blockSize)
            console.log(entry.devicePixelContentBoxSize[0].blockSize)
        })
    }))

    observer.observe(document.getElementById("test"))
