/* 
  build option
 a)incremental compilation
    If incremental: true is set in the tsconfig.json, TypeScript generates a .tsbuildinfo file in the 
    output directory. This file stores metadata about the last build, enabling TypeScript to skip 
    unchanged files in subsequent builds.
 b)You can define dependencies between projects using the references field in tsconfig.json.
    project-a depends on project-b, so TypeScript ensures project-b is built before project-a.
