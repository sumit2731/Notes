JDK - 
    JavaSDK - allows you to write java code, compile it and generate byte code,package it into a 
        application.it comes with run time.
        needs only for developing java programs not running them. but do contains JVM.

JRE -
    It is language agnostic, does care from where .class were generates, it just runs them.

JVM - Java Virtual machine. It is program that runs the byte code.
    Point 4 - Instead of JVM running the code, JVM can convert byte code into machine level code,
        which machine can execute without JVM being into a picture.There are certain optimizations
        which machine coe can do and one of them is convert some code directly into machine code.
