2)colId -The unique ID to give the column. This is optional. If missing, the ID will default to

2)width - Initial width,Always stated in pixels (never percentage values, true for maxWidth and
    minWidth).
3)minWidth -  if min and max size set,resizing the column will be restricted by these, regardless 
 of dragging the header or using on of the API buttons.

5)suppressSizeToFit - if true for a cloumn, it means its size does not change when sizeColumnsToFit 
 (method of gridAPI)is called.
