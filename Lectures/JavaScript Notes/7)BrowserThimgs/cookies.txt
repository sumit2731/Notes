        Secure - A cookie with the Secure attribute is only sent to the server with an encrypted request over the HTTPS
            protocol. It's never sent with unsecured HTTP (except on localhost), which means man-in-the-middle attackers 
            can't access it easily. Insecure sites (with http: in the URL) can't set cookies with the Secure attribute. 
            However, don't assume that Secure prevents all access to sensitive information in cookies. For example, 
            someone with access to the client's hard disk (or JavaScript if the HttpOnly attribute isn't set) can read 
            and modify the information.


        HttpOnly - A cookie with the HttpOnly attribute is inaccessible to the JavaScript Document.cookie API; it's only 
            sent to the server. For example, cookies that persist in server-side sessions don't need to be available to 
            JavaScript and should have the HttpOnly attribute. This precaution helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) 
            attacks.
