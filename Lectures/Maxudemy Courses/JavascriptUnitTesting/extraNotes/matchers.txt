1).toMatchObject(object)

2).contain()



These are used instead of values -

    1)expect.anything() - matches anything but null or undefined.

        You can use it inside toEqual or toHaveBeenCalledWith instead of a literal value
        expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.anything());


    2)expect.any(constructor) matches anything that was created with the given constructor or if it's a primitive that 
        is of the passed type.You can use it inside toEqual or toHaveBeenCalledWith instead of a literal value
        expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(Cat));
        expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(Number));
        


    3)expect.objectContaining(object)

        expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith( //receivedObject
        expect.objectContaining({ // expectedObject
        x: expect.any(Number),
        y: expect.any(Number),
        })

        expectedObject is subset of received Object
