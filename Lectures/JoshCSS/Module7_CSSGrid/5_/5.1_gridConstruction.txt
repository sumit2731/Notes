grid-template-columns - This property controls two things:

    The number of columns we want our grid to have
    The individual widths of each column

    units for column width

        a)percentage - Unlike in Flexbox, these values aren't “suggestions”, they're hard limits. 
        b)fr  - after giving size to all columns, remaining width is distributed between fr units by ratio's.
            also if width by fr ratios's causes overflow in a column, then minimum width according to content
            will be given to column with fr units.tHis behavviour happens with fr and auto.


implicit rows - If no. of items > columns, then new rows will be created. size(height) of these rows depends on
    height of largest item in that row.

Exclicit rows - we can declare exlicit rows by gird-template-rows

Out of bound items - we we give more items than explicit cell then more rows wil
