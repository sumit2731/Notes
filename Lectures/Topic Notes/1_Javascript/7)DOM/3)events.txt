Event Properties -

    1)General Event -
        a)type - "click"
        b)currentTarget - The current element on which handleed is attached. it can also be accessed by using this.
        c)target - the deepest element that originated the event.
        d)eventPhase -  the current phase (capturing=1, target=2, bubbling=3).
        e)event.defaultPrevented - The property event.defaultPrevented is true if the default action was prevented, and false 
            otherwise.
        f)event.isTrusted - True if event is coming from browser(because of user action), false in case of custom events.
        f)event.clientX/ event.clientY - Window-relative coordinates of the cursor, for pointer events.


    2)keydown event. event object has these properties -
        shiftKey: true // whether shift kay was pressed or not
        altKey: true // same as above
        charCode:
        code: 'KeyA', 'Tab', 'ShiftLeft
        key : 'a','Tab','Shift'

Event Methods -
    a)event.stopPropagation() - Stops the further travelling of event(both capturing and bubbling).but other event
        handlers on same element will be called
    b)event.stopImmediatePropagation() - To stop the further travelling of event and prevent other handlers on the current 
        element from running.

    c)event.preventDefault() - Stops the browser to take default action.For events added via attributes and DOM properties
        if we return false from handler, this is equivalent to it.

        mouseover

2)events that do not bubble -
