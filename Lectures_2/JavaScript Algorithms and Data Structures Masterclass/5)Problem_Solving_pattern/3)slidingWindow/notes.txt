Sliding indow Pattern - This is useful when we have data like array or string and we are looking
for subset of that data that is continous in some way. 
    ex- 
        1)find longest seuence of unique characters in string.
        2)Max sum of subarray(function whih accepts a number and gives maximum sum of subaaray with length n)

we make a windown which can be a single variable or can be a subarray or even another string. then 
we move that window depending on some condition. we slide it up usually from left to right, if we 
start at begining. you could go from right to left, you could start in middle i guess. but usually
we move the window from left.somtimes you might make a new window. 
    this approach is useful in situations where we are keeping track of subset of data in larger set of data.

4)Divide_and_Conquer- see lecture, example is binary search(accepets a sorted array), quik sort
merge sort
