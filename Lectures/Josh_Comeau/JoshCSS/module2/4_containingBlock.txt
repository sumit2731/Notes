lecture notes -

    a)contianing block of absolute positioned element
        top / left / right / bottom, we're positioning the element based on the element's containing block

    b)while position of absolute lement in its containing block, padding of containing block is ignored.



Also percentage values given as widthand height(top, bottom) are taken from this "containing block" not immediate parent.



Exercises -

    First exercise - skip
    Second Exercise - see second exercise, there we can see the concept, why we used em units for border radius.



Extra from course -
    1)if absolute postioned element has no parent, then it is body tag is its containing block. so if we scroll down, absoluely
        positioned element will be hidden.
