here we sw how auto-fill and auto-fit works. Then we saw difference between these 2.
then we saw how to place one item at end will auto-flow.

1)auto-fill-
    usage-
    a)grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 150px) - It means create column of 150px, but number of columns
        depends uponspace available.so it's like kind of responsive. so as we increase screen size, then
        more columns can fit into screen.
    b)grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 150px)- same as above  but it means if we can create 8 columns
        but we have only 5 items, then only 5 items will be created.
