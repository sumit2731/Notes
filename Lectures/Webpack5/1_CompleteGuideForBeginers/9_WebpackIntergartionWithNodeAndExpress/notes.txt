code1 -
    here we served prod build of single page application with express server. chnages -
        a)server .js returns index.html
        b)but since index.html had relative paths for seets , wassets were not getting loaded.
        c) served the assets through a route in express.
        d)but now all assets should be called with fetched with that route, for this used pubLicAssetPath in webpack config.


code 2 -
    here we are consuming modules from 2 apps in single app (dashboard). see figure 1.

    we load both these module in dashboard/dashboards.js


code3 -
    till now we talked about one level deep module federation.we had on host application and 2 federated modules that were
    refrenced from host.its also possible to have nested federated module. a mpdule can serve both as remote and host.

    see figure 2. kiwi is host  for ImageCaption and at a same time it will still be consumed as  federated module inside
    dashboard.
