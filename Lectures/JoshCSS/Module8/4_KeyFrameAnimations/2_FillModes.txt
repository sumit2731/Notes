Specificity of animation styles?
    Theyare treated from different origin

animation-delay

animation-fill-mode
    none
    forwards - The target will retain the computed values set by the last keyframe encountered during execution. The last keyframe 
        depends on the value of animation-direction and animation-iteration-count.

        animation-direction	        animation-iteration-count	    last keyframe encountered
        normal	                    even or odd	                    100% or to
        reverse	                    even or odd	                    0% or from
        alternate	                even	                        0% or from
        alternate	                odd	                            100% or to
        alternate-reverse	        even	                        100% or to
        alternate-reverse	        odd	                            0% or from


    backwards - The animation will apply the values defined in the first relevant keyframe as soon as it is applied to the target, and 
        retain this during the animation-delay period. The first relevant keyframe depends on the value of animation-direction.

        animation-direction	            first relevant keyframe
        
        normal or alternate	            0% or from
        reverse or alternate-reverse	100% or to

    both - The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, thus extending the animation properties in both 
        directions.
    intial (none)
    inherit

    Like all of the animation properties we're discussing, it can be tossed into the animation shorthand:

    .box {
        animation: slide-in 1000ms ease-out both;
        animation-delay: 500ms;
    }
