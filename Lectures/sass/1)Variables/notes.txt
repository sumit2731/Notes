We use the $ symbol when we wish to make something a variable.



    $color-primary: #ffff00; // Yellow

    body {
    background-color: $color-primary;
    }


    Note: You can use single line comments in Sass with //.


Advantage -

This becomes extremely powerful when working on large projects!

If you wish to make a change to a colour used throughout your stylesheets, itâ€™s much simpler to alter if the color is defined in 
    one location as a single variable.

The alternative to changing the value of one variable defined at one location is finding and replacing every reference to the 
    value you want to change. This is a much more tedious task, especially if you want to implement a quick change to test out a 
    different color or font.
