here we saw how we can center(vertically and horizontally) the absolutely positioned element in a relative element.
to do that we have to use cobination of -
    top,bottom,margin-top,margin-bottom - when margin-top and margin-right are defined it means distance between top and
        bottom of child and parent is defined. as height is also defined so now element canno occupy full height of parent.
        now defining margin-top:auto and margin-bottom:auto, places the element in middle.
