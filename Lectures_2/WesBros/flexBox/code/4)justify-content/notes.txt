justify-content - it decides how items are aligned on main axis when there is extra space left after taking all items.
    default value is flex-start.see css tricks for diffrent options that we have.

    In order to use justify content our container needs to have fixed width or height(depends upon what is our main axis, 
    but if flex-direction is row, then then even if we do not give any width then block elemnts have default width of 100%).
    To vertically center a item, flex-direction: column and justify-content: center.

    also if we have multiple rows, then justify content will align items in each row. see notes of 6 for details. there in third
    row we had only one item
    
    note- if we have used flex-grow on a item, it will take all avalible space, so there will be no empty space hence
    justify content wnt do anything as there is no empty space.
