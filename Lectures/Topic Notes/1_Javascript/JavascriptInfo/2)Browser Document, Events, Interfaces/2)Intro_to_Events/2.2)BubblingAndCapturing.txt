Bubbling - When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way 
    up on other ancestors.

    


    Almost all events bubble - Like focus event do not bubble

    event.target - element on which event actually event happened (not one who is processing it)


Stop Bubbling -

    A bubbling event goes from the target element straight up. Normally it goes upwards till <html>, and then to document 
        object, and some events even reach window, calling all handlers on the path.

    But any handler may decide that the event has been fully processed and stop the bubbling.

    event.stopPropagation()

    To stop the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running, there’s a method - 
        event.stopImmediatePropagation()

Never Stop Bubbling -

    How bubbling is used in analytics

    Allternates to stop bubbling -
        a)Use Custom events
        b)we can write our data into the event object in one handler and read it in another one, so we can pass to 
            handlers on parents information about the processing below.


Capturing
    Rarely used in real code

    3 Phases of Event Propagation -
        Capturing Phase
        Target Phase
        Bubble Phase

    All the ways where we saw to add event listener to DOM elements, added them for Capturing and Bubbling phase.
    To add Event listener for capture phase -

        elem.addEventListener(..., {capture: true})
        // or, just "true" is an alias to {capture: true}
        elem.addEventListener(..., true)

    the 2nd phase (“target phase”: the event reached the element) is not handled separately: handlers on both capturing 
        and bubbling phases trigger at that phase.see example in code, it is called 2 times.


event.eventPhase that tells us the number of the phase on which the event was caught


To remove the handler, removeEventListener needs the same phase
    If we addEventListener(..., true), then we should mention the same phase in removeEventListener(..., true) to 
        correctly remove the handler.

Listeners on the same element and same phase run in their set order

event.stopPropagation() during the capturing also prevents the bubbling
