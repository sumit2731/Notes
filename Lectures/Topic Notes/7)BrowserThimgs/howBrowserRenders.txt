Steps-

    1)First, the raw bytes of data are converted into characters.This conversion is done based on the character encoding of the 
        HTML file.
    2)Characters are converted into tokens.
    3)After the tokenization is done, the tokens are then converted into nodes.
        You may think of nodes as distinct objects with specific properties. In fact, a better way to explain this is to see a node 
            as a separate entity within the document object tree.

    4)Upon creating these nodes, the nodes are then linked in a tree data structure known as the DOM.
