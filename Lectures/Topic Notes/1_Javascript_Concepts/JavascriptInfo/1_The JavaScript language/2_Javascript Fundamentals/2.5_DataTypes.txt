number -
    Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: 
        Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
    NaN is sticky doing any mathematical operation on this gives undefined.here’s only one exception to that:
     NaN ** 0 is 1).
    
    Mathematical operations are safe.

BigInt -
    numbers cannot represent values larger that pow(2,53)-1. so we have bigInt for same. reason - not all numbers
    can be stored in 64 bit storage. so in js numbers are accurate up to 15 digites.BigInt is recent addition to js.
    IE does not support it.

    const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

    Remember, we cannot mix normal numbers with BigInts. If we try to, it will result in an error.

null -
    typeof null => object
    this is legacy behaviour

typeof x, but typeof(x)
