mouseover & mouseout


relatedTarget

    For mouseover:

        event.target – is the element where the mouse came over.
        event.relatedTarget – is the element from which the mouse came (relatedTarget → target).

    For mouseout the reverse

        event.target – is the element that the mouse left.
        event.relatedTarget – is the new under-the-pointer element, that mouse left for (target → relatedTarget).


Skipping elements
    If mouseover triggered, there must be mouseout

Mouseout when leaving for a child
    According to the browser logic, the mouse cursor may be only over a single element at any time – the most nested one and top by z-index.

Events mouseenter and mouseleave

    Events mouseenter/mouseleave are like mouseover/mouseout. They trigger when the mouse pointer enters/leaves the element.
    But there are two important differences:

        Transitions inside the element, to/from descendants, are not counted.
        Events mouseenter/mouseleave do not bubble.
