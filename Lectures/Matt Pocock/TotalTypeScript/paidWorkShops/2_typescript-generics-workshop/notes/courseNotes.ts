/**
 * 3)we can more tighter inference by TS by tighting the constraints. see comments on
    solution

9)here we saw that we can accept generics into function and we can pass them to another type
    helper.

12)You can represent the generic at different levels. and generally it is ggod idea to define genric
    ar lower level and pick what we excatly want.

14 - here again we used generics at different levels to get result. but here we also got to know how to define
    generic in order to get correct inference for function parameters. see comments of solutio1.

14.5 - See how typescript handles infers generics in function depending upon what we return from 
    function.
