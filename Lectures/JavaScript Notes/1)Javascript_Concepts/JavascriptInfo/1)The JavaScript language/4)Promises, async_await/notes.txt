1)In promise chain, from each then block we need to return a promise, if we return a non primise value, it will be 
    wrapped in a promise. see code snippet 1 in app.js.

2)In promise.then instead of returning a promise, we can return promise.then also. promise. then also returns promise.
    so next promise in chain still receives that promise. resolved value of that proise will be whatever we return from
    first callback to null(first rule will be applied on this)

    from snippet 2 we return a normal value so it is wrapped in a promise.
    from snippet 3 we return a value so it is not wrapped into the promise
