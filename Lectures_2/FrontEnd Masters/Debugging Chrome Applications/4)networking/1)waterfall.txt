In network tab by cliking on settings , we can configure what we can see. you can show or hide waterfall graph and other things.

In network tab we can also see initiator i.e which file made this request.there is cool trick to see initiator-
    press shift and hover over api call for which you want to see initiator.it will show in green what file(in netwrok tab 
    itself) has fetched it and in red it will show what other files are loaded by file on which you hover over.
