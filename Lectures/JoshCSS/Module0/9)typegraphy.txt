To change font -
    font-family: Arial;

    It's called a “family” because each font consists of multiple character sets: for example, “Roboto” includes 12 
    individual sets: 6 font weights, with 2 variants (normal and italic).


    There are a handful of “web safe fonts”. These are fonts that come pre-installed on all major operating systems- 
        Arial
        Times New Roman
        Tahoma.



    Font families come in different styles. The 3 most popular:

        Serif
        Sans-serif
        Monospace

    To font-family property we can pass font name or font styles.By passing a category instead of a specific font, the operating 
    system will use its default system font from this category. For example, when specifying sans-serif, Windows 11 will use 
    “Segoe UI”, while MacOS Ventura uses SF Pro.

web fonts - A web font is a custom font that we load in our CSS, allowing us to use any font we like. For example, AirBnb developed 
    its own font in-house, Cereal, and uses it across their web and native apps.

    Using web fonts -

        downloading web fonts -

            <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
            <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

        Using it -
            font-family: 'Roboto', Arial, sans-serif;

            name of web font is in ''.
            font stack - multiple comma separated values for font-family.The idea is that the browser will use the first available 
                font from the list. If Roboto isn't available (eg. because the download failed, or it's simply taking too long), we'll
                use Arial instead. And if the user's device doesn't have Arial, it'll fall back to the system-default sans-serif font.

3 most common formatting options:

    a)bold - We can create bold text with the font-weight property:

        font-weight: bold;

        There's also a numbering system, from 1 to 1000, which lets us control the font weight more precisely:

            /* Light, thin text*/
            font-weight: 300;
            /* Normal text */
            font-weight: 400;
            /* Heavy, bold text */
            font-weight: 700;

        The default value for font weight is 400, and the bold keyword maps to 700.


    b)italic -

        font-style: italic;

        Similar to bold text, the browser can simulate italic text by rendering the characters at an angle. For best results, though, we should 
        supply an italic character set.
    
    c)Underlined text - We can toggle an element's underline with the text-decoration property:

        /* remove underlines from anchor tags: */
        a {
            text-decoration: none;
        }

semantic html tags -

    <strong>
    <em>


Alignment -
    We can shift characters horizontally using the text-align property. to see details of how text-align works, see this-
        CSS basics/centerAlignment

Text-transform -

    /* RENDER WITH ALL CAPS */
    text-transform: uppercase;
    /* Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Word */
    text-transform: capitalize;

Spacing -

    We can tweak the spacing of our characters in two ways.

        a)We can tweak the horizontal gap between characters using the letter-spacing property.
            letter-spacing: 3px;
        
        b)We can tweak the vertical distance between lines using the line-height property.
