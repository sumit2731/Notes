here we refactored the code of section1, and used hooks to outsource the animation logic instead of using Higher order
    components.

if hit roadblock because our hook was triggered first and then state containing element refrences was updated later.
    for that we used dependencues in if check in useEffect and used dependecies in useEffect.

still then we were facing the problem of inifne renders that was solved using useCallback
