dialogs vs modals
    modals - you cannot interact with rest of page, until modal is closed
    dialogs - you can interact with rest of page


Attributes -
    open - dialog is visible, it is non-modal dialog

Open dialog through js -
    const dialog = document.querySelector("dialog")
    dialog.show() // Opens a non-modal dialog
    dialog.showModal() // Opens a modal
        a)now modal is opened in separate layer
    dialog.close()

benefits -
    It handles accessibility for you by default.
        a)modal is centered by default
        a)All the proper aria-attributes and focus states are taken care
        b)modal will be closed by pressing escape key
        c)focus trapping
        d)When dialog is opened first focusable element is opened by default

Custom Stylings -
    a)styling of dialog -
        You can style the modal way you want
    b)styling of backdrop -
        backdrop is handled using - ::backdrop
        
        dialog::backdrop {
            background-color: hsl(250, 100%, 50%, 0.25);
        }

Advance Usecases - 
    a)form
        <form method="dialog">
    b)formmethod
        <form>
            <button formmethod="dialog" type="submit">Cancel</button>
        <form>

    c)ckosing the dialog on click of backdrop - by default not added, bit can be added easily


From video -
    problem with regular modal -
        a)Extra element or pseudo element for overlay
        b)hide modal by default and show it only when required
        c)focus trapping is not there, using tab you can focus outside of dialog
