Example -
    a)We had 3 items in flexbiox. we wanted 2 items to move to extreme right. ways to that -
        a)wrap last 2 items into extra div and then use justify-content: space-between.
        b)use margin-right: auto, on first child

    b)the we wanted to have a gap between last 2 items
        a)way 1 - use margin-left on both.
        b)use gap proeprty of flexbox





Here we saw that how we can control the placement of individual items, along cross axis using margin-auto.
    people who are not aware of this property do this by adding a extra div.

Note that this margin:auto trick works in main axis of flexbox. if we chnage main axis to vertiacl axis, then instead of setting 
    margin-left or margin-right to auto we need to do same for margin-top and bottom. exercise does the same

Adding space between flex items -
    a)Using gap property (not Supported in IE)
    b)using margin:auto
    c)If induival elements are coming from libarry and we do not add amrgin to it, we can use a spacer component.
        empty element with some min-width. we use min-width because we dot want thos to shrink when our flexbox is shrinking.


My Observations -
    In lecture we saw that margin:auto centers the flex-item in main axis(both horizontal and vertical). but thing to be 
    noticed is that it also aligns the flex-items in cross axis. but alike align-item it does so in individual rows.
