1)function with keyword async always return promise.Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.
    We could explicitly return a promise, which would be the same. basically it works in same way how returning from 
    then works.

2)await keyword works only inside function with keyword async.
3)The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.
4)await literally suspends the function execution until the promise settles, and then resumes it with the promise result. 
    That doesn’t cost any CPU resources, because the JavaScript engine can do other jobs in the meantime: execute other scripts, 
    handle events, etc.It’s just a more elegant syntax of getting the promise result than promise.then. And, it’s easier to read 
    and write.

5)If a promise resolves normally, then await promise returns the result. But in the case of a rejection, it throws the error, just as 
    if there were a throw statement at that line.
