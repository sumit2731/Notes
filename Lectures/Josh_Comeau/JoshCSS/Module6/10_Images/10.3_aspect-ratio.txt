aspect-ratio: 3 / 2;


Not supported in Internet Explorer.

padding trick to support this bheaviour in internet Explorer.
    Inside flex-items container, we defined a box which has padding-top: 100%, that means height is linked with width. width is 100%.
    but problem is inside it we cannot place image as content size is 0, as we have given it height: 0px.
    we solved this problem by making position as absolute.


Then we learnt about @supports feature query.and how we can have a fallback for browser that do not support aspect-ratio.

    @supports (aspect-ratio: 1 / 1) {
        img {
            height: revert;
            aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
        }
    }
