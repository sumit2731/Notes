css reset -
    2 jobs -
        a)make css across all browser.
        b)flatten the css, overwrite the global browser defaults.

Also here josh showed instead of specify global styles we can define component and use. but that becomes a bit hectic.
    also josh explained we should not write lot of things in global stylesheet i.e write only those things that we are
    able to remeber.
