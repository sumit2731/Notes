1)solved squareroot using tradational loops, but in course binarySearch approach is used. binary search solution is better.
2)ReverseVowels - everse vowel took some time to solve in single loop
3)here remeber the expression to check if char is alphanumeric
4)I solved the question but course solution is better.
5)shortestDistance is excellent question, i solved it using more complexity. course solution is excellent one.
6)you solved it but course solution was more elegent


iteration 2 -

    1)contains duplicate - solved
    2)Pangram

    2)ReverseVowels - solved but bit rusty
    3)Remember regularExpression for alpha numeric
    4)Solved, course solution 1% better.
    5)I solved it , but course solution complexity is better(less time complexity)
    6)i solved in O (n * n), course had O (n * n)
