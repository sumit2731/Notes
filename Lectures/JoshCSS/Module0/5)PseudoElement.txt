Pseudo-elements are like pseudo-classes, but they don't target a specific state. Instead, they target "sub-elements" within an element.
In terms of syntax, pseudo-elements use two colons instead of one (::), though some pseudo-elements also support single-colon syntax.

examples -

    1)::placeholder
        
        css -
            <style>
                input {
                    font-size: 1rem;
                }
                input::placeholder {
                    color: goldenrod;
                }
            </style>


        html -
            
            <label>
                Postal Code:
                <input
                    type="text"
                    placeholder="A1A 1A1"
                />
            </label>



    If we stop and think about it, something pretty interesting is happening here. We haven't explicitly created a <placeholder> element, 
    but by adding the placeholder attribute to the <input> tag, a pseudo-element is created.This is why they're called pseudo-elements 
    â€” these selectors target elements in the DOM that we haven't explicitly created with HTML tags.

    2)::before, ::after
        These pseudo-elements are added inside the element, right before and after the element's content. see lecture of course for details.
