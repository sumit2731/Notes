“Interaction Media Features”.

    hover - It is the ability for a device to move the cursor without also triggering a click/tap on the element underneath; a 
        mouse can do this, but your finger or a stylus can't.

    pointer - pointer refers to the level of control the user has over the position of the cursor.


    @media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
        button:hover {
            text-decoration: underline;
        }
    }


Preferance based Media Queries
    Another feature of media queries is that they can "hook in" and access user preferences.

    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        /* Dark-mode styles here */
    }

    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
        /* Animations here */
    }


orientation -

    @media (orientation: portrait) {
        /* Styles for windows that are taller than they are wide */
    }

    @media (orientation: landscape) {
        /* Styles for windows that are wider than they are tall */
    }


I've done some pretty extensive experimentation with this media query, and have found that it's not usually worth using
