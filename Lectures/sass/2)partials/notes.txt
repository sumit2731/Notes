Partials are scss files which are not converetd by css files by pre-processor. they start with _.
 processor knows that this file is not be converetd into css. 


Now why would you want to create scss from which you don't get any CSS code.

Well a very common use case is that you want to just define all your variables in a separate file. For

example or you could even go so far to just have your colors in a separate file, your fonts-sizes and anything else 
you want to define. This basically depends on the size of your project.If you have lot of colors then , you can 
define your colors in a partial.

In code ,we will define all our variables in a partial - _variables.scss.
then we include it in main.scss using syntax-
    @import "variables";

Here we do not use _.

you could go even further in larger projects and actually create partials for colors,for typography.

It's also common to create a partial for reset(You may know the normalized reset that's out there for you to use to get rid of any
 browser incompatibilities).

so you can use this whenever you don't actually want a css file from that but you just want to define

variables Or you just want to use that file as an import for other files like this reset for example.
Because normally you don't want your normalization or reset code to be a style sheet by itself but instead
you just include that as the basis for your actual design to get rid of all the browsing incompatibilities.
