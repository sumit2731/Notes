Understanding WCAG standards


WCAG - set of standards or measurable criteria. And the standards for measuring accessibility on the Web are the Web 
    Content Accessibility Guidelines (or WCAG).


    version -
        WCAG 1.0 - only html, 14 guideline
        WCAG 2.0 -
            WCAG 2.1 (stable,will be used in course)
            WCAG 2.2 (WIP)
        WCAG 3.0 (work in progress)


4 Design Principles -

    Perceivable means that users must be able to perceive Web content in some way, using one or more of their senses (it can’t 
        be invisible to all of their senses)
    Operable means that users must be able to control UI elements (e.g. buttons must be activated in some way — mouse, keyboard, 
        voice command, etc.). The user interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform.
    Understandable means that the content must be understandable to its users.
    Robust means that the content must be developed using well-adopted web standards that will work across different browsers, 
        now and in the future.

To guide you towards applying these principles in your work, each principle is supported by a set of guidelines.


Success Criteria ()78 -
    A success criterion (SC) is a testable, technical statement that targets one or more specific accessibility issue(s). 
    They’re kind of like antibodies in that sense.

conforming to WCAG
    3 Levels -
        A
        AA
        AAA

    Every success criterion is assigned one of these three conformance levels

    SC criteria 1.4.3- AA - contrast ration 4.5:1
    SC criteria 1.4.6 -AAA - contrast ratio 7:1
