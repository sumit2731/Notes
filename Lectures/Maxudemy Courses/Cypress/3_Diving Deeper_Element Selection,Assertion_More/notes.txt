30)selecting Element best practice way

    html -
        <a data-cy="header-about-link"></a>
    test file -
        cy.get('[data-cy="header-about-link"]')
        
31)testing page navigation
    we saw how to get url of page, how to make assertions based on that.
    we also saw how to move forward and back in browser navigation.


32)More on selecting Elements
    here we saw how we can find good selector of element in cypress test.


34)chaining elements
    here we saw that we can use 'and' to chain the commands. see first test of contact.cy

35)Working with values & alias
    storing results of command like (cy.get) in a variable is not recommneded. it works but is not reccommended.
    use aliases isntead by uisng chainable as method,it allows you to assign any alias of your choice to a value, for example
    a element dervied by cypress command. later you can use reause this command or element that is yiedled by this command
    by using this alias. this alias can be used with get method by refrencing it with '@'.

    so this is offical way of reusing  a value yielded by a command.
    
    cy.get('[data-cy="contact-btn-submit"]')
            .as('submitBtn')
            .contains('Send Message')

     cy.get('@submitBtn').click();
