In English, the word facade means a deceptive front or appearance. Following this definition, a facade pattern provides a 
    simpler interface that hides the complex functionalities of a system. This is widely used in JavaScript libraries like 
    jQuery.

The facade pattern allows you to hide all the messy logic from the client and only display the clear and easy-to-use 
    interface to them. This allows them to interact with an API easily in a less error-prone way and without accessing 
    the inner workings directly.


When to use the facade pattern?#
The facade pattern is used to simplify a clientâ€™s interaction with a system. So, it can be used when an application has 
a large and complex underlying code that the client does not need to see.

It can also be used when you want to interact with the methods present in a library without knowing the processing that 
happens in the background. An example can be of the JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.
