here we refactored the code of section1, and used hooks to outsource the animation logic instead of using Higher order
    component. 01.hs has HOC code but 02.js has hooks code. code is in previous section pnly.

we hit roadblock because our hook was triggered first and then state containing element refrences was updated later.
    for that we used dependencues and if check in useEffect.


still then we were facing the problem of inifne renders that was solved using useCallback. basic problem here is if state is object,
then infine cycle continue. but after using useCallback hook that problem was solved. this is still a questions t me why it happens.

when state is object and useCallback is not used, then ref calllback function is called infine nuber of times.
when state is not object and useCallback is not used, then ref calllback function is called 3 times.
when state is object and useCallback is used, then ref callback is used only once.
