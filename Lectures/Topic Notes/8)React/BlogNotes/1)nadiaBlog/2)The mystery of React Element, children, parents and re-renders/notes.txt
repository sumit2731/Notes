children are just like normal props.


When you create react element then, component function is not called, it is called when that same react elements ends up in render tree.
When a react elements is already in render tree, it will be called only when you re-create that react element.
    Reason for same is react components are suposed to be pure, for same props same output shuld be returned.jsx is replaced by -
    
    React.createElement(componentType, {});

    when we recreate react elemnt then,here props object is created newly each time, hence component function will be called.
    however if do not create react element again, then component function won't be called again.

Only way when a react element will re-render is, when you recreate the react element. so here re-render will not happen, because react
    element is not recreated.
    
    const Parent = () => {
        const child = useMemo(() => <Child />, []);
        return <div>{child}</div>;
    };

question - Although the last one probably shouldnâ€™t do, no one on your team will appreciate it.
