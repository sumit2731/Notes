Partials in SASS help us to break up our files into smaller files without affecting performance.

The use of partials allows us to modularize our CSS, to help keep things maintainable.

We divide up our Sass into separate files representing different components. A partialsâ€™ name will always start with an 
underscore _. We then import the partial using an @import directive.
