Objects -
    1)Object Literal notation
    2)Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).
    3)use of square bracket to add and access properties(it allow us to use Invalid variable identifier and variables)
        Valid Indetifiers -
            contains no spaces, doesn’t start with a digit and doesn’t include special characters ($ and _ are allowed)

    square bracket also allows us to add vraible property name in literal notation
        
        let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");

        let bag = {
            [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
        };

    4)property value shorthand
    5)Property existence test, “in” operator - "key" in object
    6)for...in loop (All Enurable proprties in object)
    7)order in which properties appear in for in loop - integer properties are sorted, others appear in creation order.

Object references and copying - 

Grabage Collection-
    a)recahability principle.

methods,this-
    1)method shorthand.There are subtle differences related to object inheritance (to be covered later), but for now they 
        do not matter.

Constructor, operator "new" -
    a)new function() { … }
        let user = new function() {
            this.name = "John";
            this.isAdmin = false;

            // ...other code for user creation
            // maybe complex logic and statements
            // local variables etc
        };

    b)Constructor mode test: new.target
    c)Return from constructors
    d)omitting parenthesis
        let user = new User; // <-- no parentheses
        // same as
        let user = new User();
