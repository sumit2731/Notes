why class based components -

    prior to 16.8 you have to use class based components in some cases, specifically while dealing with state and with side 
    effects. prior to 16.8 we cannot chnage state in functional components and we can also cannot handle side effects in 
    fucntional components. but in 16.8 'react hooks' were introduced.

    so hooks are functions for functiona based components which brings features to functionl components which were previously
    reserved for class based components. class based components cannot use react hooks.

2)handling state in class based components -
    see code/current/src/components/

3)Handling side effects in class based component -
    see slide 5
    see code in code/UserSearch.js and code/User component.

4)using context in class based components -
    we can connect functionl components to multiple contexts but class based component can be connected to only one context.
    there are 2 ways of comsuming the context in react components -
        a)you have to use context.Consumer component
        b)use this context, see code/UserSearch.js
