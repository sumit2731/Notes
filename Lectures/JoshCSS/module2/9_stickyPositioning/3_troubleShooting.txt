Unfortunately, it's very common to apply position: sticky to an element, only for nothing to happen; the element won't stick!
Let's look at some common reasons for this.

    a)A parent is hiding/managing overflow
    b)The container isn't big enough
    c)The sticky element is stretched
    d)There's a thin gap above my sticky header!
