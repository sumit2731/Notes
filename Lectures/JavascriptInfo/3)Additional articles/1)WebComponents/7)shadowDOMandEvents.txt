1)Events that happen in shadow DOM have the host element as the target, when caught outside of the component.
2)Retargeting does not occur if the event occurs on a slotted element, that physically lives in the light DOM.


1)event.composedPath() - gives array of elemnts on which event will be triggered.
2)event.composed - Events only cross shadow DOM boundaries if their composed flag is set to true.
    For most built in events it is true.
    If it’s true, then the event does cross the boundary. Otherwise, it only can be caught from inside the shadow 
        DOM.
    If we dispatch a CustomEvent, then we should explicitly set composed: true., if you want your event to cross 
    shadow DOM boudary.


    Please note that in case of nested components, one shadow DOM may be nested into another. In that case composed 
    events bubble through all shadow DOM boundaries. So, if an event is intended only for the immediate enclosing 
    component, we can also dispatch it on the shadow host and set composed: false. Then it’s out of the component 
    shadow DOM, but won’t bubble up to higher-level DOM.

    

This is true if event is able to propogate acrosss shadow DOM, for custome events you need to
    set it true.
