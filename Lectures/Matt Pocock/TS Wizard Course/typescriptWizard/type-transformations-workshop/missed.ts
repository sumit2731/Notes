/**

/**
 * 17- 20  - I solved all but also see alternate solutions
 *
 * alternate solution used Record. See definition of Record to see how we can put constraint of something to be
 *  of union type
 *
 *
 * 20.6 - {} can be used to in generic condition to accept any value other than null or undefied.
 *
 * Object or {} - represents all values except null or undefined
 * object - represents all non-primitive values
 *
 * This also tells us how Typescript matches object i.r extra properties are allowed. this also explains a bit
 *  how extends works in case of object
