Cases where scss import is same as css import i.e these will ve translated into css imports -

    @import url() => @import url("navigation.css");
    @import "http://"
    @import "filename.css" => @import "navigation.css"
    @import "style-screen" screen; = > @import "mobstyle.css" screen and (max-width: 768px); 

        this means import the "mobstyle.css" style sheet ONLY if the media is screen and the viewport is maximum 768 pixels:



How sccss enhanes @imports, it allows us to import scss files -

 1)@import "varibales"

    this impots variables.scss as scss into this file. we dnt need to put "_" or ".scss" here.
    it will look in same directory as the file in which code is written. in case file is located somewhere else,
    we can use relative paths.

    @import "folder1/variables";
    or
    @import "./folder1/variables";


 Code snippet -

    creating a mixin to import google fonts-

    @mixin google-font($font) {
        $font: unquote($font);
        /* 
        you can only use this interpellation syntax in the context of imports when 
        you're using css imports.So you're not allowed to import SPSS files based on 
        some variable name.
        */
        @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=#{$font}")
        #{$font} means use variable here
    }

    @include google-font("Alegreya+Sans");
    @include google-font("Titillium+Web");
