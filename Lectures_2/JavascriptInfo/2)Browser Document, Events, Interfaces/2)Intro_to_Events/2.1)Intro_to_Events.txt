Important Properties of Event Object-

1)Event.bubbles(Read only) - A boolean indicating whether or not the event bubbles up through the DOM.There are two types of 
    events, one propagates up the DOM hierarchy, the other does not. For example the onclick event bubbles up the 
    DOM hierarchy, the onfocus event does not.Therefore the bubbles property returns true in case of the onclick 
    event and returns false when an onfocus event happened.

2)Event.cancelBubble -When an event can bubble up(you can check that by bubles proeprty), you can stop its propagation with 
    the cancelBubble property or the stopPropagation method. Use the stopPropagation method in Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome
     and Safari, because the cancelBubble property is deprecated in those browsers. Internet Explorer also supports the 
     stopPropagation method from version 9. In Internet Explorer before version 9, use the cancelBubble property, because 
     the stopPropagation method is not supported.With the cancelBubble property, you cannot allow the propagation of events
      that cannot bubble up, you can only prevent the propagation of events that can. Note that the use of the stopPropagation 
      method or the cancelBubble property on an event that cannot propagate does not cause an error.

3)Event.cancelable(Read only) - Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the current event can be canceled or not.
    If an event is cancelable, you can use the preventDefault method and the returnValue property to cancel the event. 
    When an event is canceled, the default action that belongs to the event will not be executed. For example, when the 
    onclick event (the onclick event is cancelable) is canceled for a checkbox, then clicking on the checkbox does not 
    change its checked state.

    Note that the use of the preventDefault method and the returnValue property on a non-cancelable event does not cause 
    an error. When an event handler returns false, the event will be canceled. You can use it instead of the preventDefault 
    method and the returnValue property.

Doubts-

1) An event is a signal that something has happened. All DOM nodes generate such signals (but events are not 
        limited to DOM).

    question - what is node?

2)element.addEventListener(event, handler, [options]);

    options argument.
