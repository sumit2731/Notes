position: sticky is the newest addition to the crew. The idea is that as you scroll, an element can "stick" to the edge.
At that moment, it transitions from being relatively-positioned to being fixed-positioned.

In addition to setting position: sticky, you also need to pick at least one edge to stick to (top, left, right, bottom).
Most commonly, this is done with top: 0px (or top: 0; the unit is optional when it's zero).


There's a lot of subtlety with position: sticky. Let's go through some of the details.
    a)Stays in it's box.
    b)offset -
        With sticky positioning, the value controls the minimum gap between the element and the edge of the viewport while 
            the container is in-frame.

    c)Not incorporeal - It is their in document flow.

Extra things -
    1)position:sticky does not do anything until and unless you mention some offset like top: 0px.
    2)negative values also work
