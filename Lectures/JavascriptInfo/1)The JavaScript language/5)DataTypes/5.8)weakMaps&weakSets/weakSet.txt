WeakSet behaves similarly:

    It is analogous to Set, but we may only add objects to WeakSet (not primitives).
    An object exists in the set while it is reachable from somewhere else.
    Like Set, it supports add, has and delete, but not size, keys() and no iterations.


The most notable limitation of WeakMap and WeakSet is the absence of iterations, and the inability to get 
    all current content. That may appear inconvenient, but does not prevent WeakMap/WeakSet from doing their
    main job – be an “additional” storage of data for objects which are stored/managed at another place.
