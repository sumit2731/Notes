 /* 
 lets see how we do it without enums
 
 *approach1-
 let person = {
     name: 'sumeet',
     role:1
 };
 problem - here we will loose track what role no 1 and we can assign any number value to
 role

 *approach2-

 let person = {
     name: 'sumeet',
     role:'READ_ONLY_ROLE'
 };
 problem -
 if (person.role == 'READ-ONLY-ROLE') {
    console.log("We will never reach here");
 }
 problem - here we will never execute statement inside if because we are using wrong string for
 comparison, so we have to rememebr strings and again we can assign any string value to role. also we
 do not get any suggestions by ide


 *approach 3-
 const READ_ONLY_ROLE = 'READ_ONLY_ROLE';

 let person = {
     name: 'sumeet',
     role: READ_ONLY_ROLE
 };
 
 if (person.role ==  READ_ONLY_ROLE) {
    console.log("We will never reach here");
 }

 problem - Here we get IDE suggestions, but we hve to define and maintain these global constants and 
 again we can assign any value .string value to role.

 lets undertsand ENUMS and see how we can solve this problem by enums.
 */

 /* 
 this is how we create enums. enum keyword, {} then our identifiers
 These lables translates to numbers starting from 0 and we have human readable
 */
enum Role {ADMIN, READ_ONLY,AUTHOR};
/* 
Here we do not start from 1, so we have 5,6 and 7
*/
enum Role2 {ADMIN =5, READ_ONLY,AUTHOR};
// we can assign our own values
enum Role3 {ADMIN =11, READ_ONLY=12,AUTHOR=13};
// we dnt always have to go with numbers, we can assign our own values
enum Role4 {ADMIN ='Role1', READ_ONLY='Role2',AUTHOR=13};
// this is how we solve problem by enum, now role can have some minimum set of values
//that we have defined in enum and we get IDE suggestions
let role = Role.ADMIN;
if(role == Role.ADMIN) {
    //prints 0
    console.log(role);
}

/**
 * @From Ts Docs
 * A handy feature of enums is that you can also go from a numeric value to the name of that value in the enum. For example, 
 *  if we had the value 2 but werenâ€™t sure what that mapped to in the Color enum above, we could look up the 
 *  corresponding name:
 */


enum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue}
let colorName: string = Color[2];
console.log(colorName); // Displays 'Green' as its value is 2 above

// above does not work if enum holds value other name numbers, for example like string


/**
 * @Desc any type, do not use it, you will loose all ts advantages. 
 */

 let name1: any = 'sumeet';
