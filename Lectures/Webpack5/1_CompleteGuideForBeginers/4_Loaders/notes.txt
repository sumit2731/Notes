Loaders
    Loaders allow you to import all other kinds of files that you can't handle using Asset Modules.
    Webpack was designed to help you bundle all your dependencies into one or more files. What kind
        of dependencies are we talking about?

    Usually, dependencies are other JavaScript modules that your main JavaScript file requires in order
        to do its job.

    But we can do more than that! With Webpack, you can import css files right into your JavaScript code,
        you can import SASS, LESS, handlebars, XML and so much more!

    There are a lot of things you can import using Webpack. And Webpack loaders are JavaScript libraries
        that help you import all that stuff.In the next videos, we are going to talk about various loaders
        that you most probably will use in your projects.


    css-loader,style-loader -
        here we added these loader into webpack config. here we are appyling multiple loaders on same file.
        output of css-loader is input to style-loader.also assets modules are built into webpack but webpack
        loaders are npm packages that needs to be downloaded.see config file for more details

        npm i css-loader style-loader

    scss loader -
        npm i scss scss-loader

        here we install sass with sass-loader, there are many implementation of sass and you can use any but this one
            is primary so it means that it gets the new feature fatser than any other implementation.

    babel-loader -
        Here we used a class variable in helllo-world-button.js
        if we compile it webpack gives error that you need a appropriate loader to do this.so using loaders, you can use
        syntax which is not even part of Ecmascript standard.


        npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties --save-dev
