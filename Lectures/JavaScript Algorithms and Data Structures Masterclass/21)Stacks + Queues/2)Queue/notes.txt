Queue-
    Implements first in ,first out. Implements only 2 operations, adding and removing.

Where it is used-

    1)When user wait to join a game
    2)Background tasks in computer,uploading resources
    3)Print Queue

ImPlementation-
    There are lot of diffrent ImPlementations only rules which governs it is, First in first out. rest ImPlementation
    details are same as stack.

Array Implementation-
    we can imppelemnt it by  either using (push and shift) (entry from last and removeal from begining)
        or
    (pop and unshift) (entry from begining and removal from last of array)

    so either we use shift or unshift. for array compelxity of doing that is O(n), so itnreally makes sense to
        implement your own class if you are conceren about performance.

Linked List Implementation -
    Here we will add at end remove from begining, instead of removing from end and adding at end. becaue of complexity reasons
    in linked list.

Big O -
    Insert - O(1)
    removal - O(1)
    Search- O(n)
    Access- O(n)

    Theory is same as stack.

We will uses queses an stacks later in this course, they are foundation of more
complex data strictures.
