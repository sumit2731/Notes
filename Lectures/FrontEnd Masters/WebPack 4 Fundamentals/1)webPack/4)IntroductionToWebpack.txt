apart for ESM problems. we have preprocessors for HTML and CSS, we have assets. now we need something that not oly let us write 
    modules, but we need something that lets us supports any module format. atleast untill we get to ESM, that can handle 
    reources and other assets at same time.

webpack lets us write any module format and then compiles them for browser.on top of that it supports code spliting or
    static sync bundling.

webpack was orignally born as fork of modules-webpack. webpack was born in 2012.
