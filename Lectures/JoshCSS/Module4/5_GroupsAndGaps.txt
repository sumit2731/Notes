Here we saw that how we can control the placement of individual items, along corss axis using margin-auto.
    people who are not aware of this property do this by adding a extra div.

Note that this margin:auto trick works in main axis of flexbox. if we chnage main axis to vertiacl axis, then instead of setting 
    margin-left or margin-right to auto we need to do same for margin-top and bottom. exercise does the same

Adding space between flex items -
    a)using margins
    b)use gap property(not supported in IE).gap property adds a gap between flex-items.
    c)By using a spacer flex-items. use min-width as we do not want flex-shrink to eat space between flex-items.
