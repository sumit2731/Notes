DOM Collections-
    1)HTMLCollection
    2)NodeList 

DOM collections, and even more – all navigation properties listed in this chapter are read-only.
  We can’t replace a child by something else by assigning childNodes[i] = ....
  Changing DOM needs other methods. We will see them in the next chapter.

Almost all DOM collections with minor exceptions are live. use for in loops to iterate over collections.

Node Navigation -
  
  1)Node.parentNode
  2)Node.nextSibling
  3)Node.previousSibling
  4)Node.childNodes - returns all node children.It lists all child nodes, including text nodes.
  5)firstChild and lastChild

Navigation properties listed above refer to all nodes. For instance, in childNodes we can see both text nodes, 
element nodes, and even comment nodes if there exist.

Element Only Navigation-

  
  1)Element.parentElement
  2)Element.previousElementSibling
  3)Element.nextElementSibling
  4)Element.childern(live Html Collection) - returns only element children
  5)Element.firstElementChild, Element.lastElementChild



Some types of DOM elements, e.g. tables, provide additional properties and collections to access their content.

1)Node.contains() method returns a Boolean value indicating whether a node is a descendant of a given node, i.e. 
    the node itself, one of its direct children (childNodes), one of the children's direct children, and so on.

    node.contains( otherNode ) 

2)ParentNode.prepend() -  method inserts a set of Node objects or DOMString objects before the first child of the
  ParentNode. DOMString objects are inserted as equivalent Text nodes.
    ParentNode.prepend(...nodesToPrepend);


  Triggering Events on DOM Node -

    1)element.click()
    2)element.focus()
