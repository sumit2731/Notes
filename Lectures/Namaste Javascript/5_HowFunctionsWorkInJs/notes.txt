Here we saw that while execution each function has its own variable env which is different from variable envirenment
    of other execution contexts, so diffrent EC can have variables of same name.then we saw call stack and this 
    varible env in browser debugger tools.

    see figure1.Here we can see, how variables of outer scope are avalible as closure.Also this closure is only shown
    if we are using outer variables inside function.
