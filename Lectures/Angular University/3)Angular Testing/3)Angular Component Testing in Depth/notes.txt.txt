1)testing Presentational Component
    here we started with presentational component testing. presentational
    components simply take some input data and just show it on screen. courses-card-list.component
    is such kind of componenet.generally we follow not to test these kind of components and chose
    to test complex components.
    but here we will test them, because of 2 reaons-
        1)sometimes you have to test them because of test coverage requirements
        2)we will show how angular unit testing can validate the content of DOM if needed.

    As you can see courses-card-list.component does'nt need any services to get data, it receives data as
    parameters. It uses a service just to open dialog box when user clicks on edit.see spec file of it to
    see how we can test these type of components.here we test courses-card-list.component which is presentational
    type of component.

2)Testing smart or container component
    these types of components genrally get their data from observable based service and not froma @input.
    HomeCompoent is such tpe of component. it gets it data from courses service which we have tested before.
    In this section we try to test home component but we run into a problem. that problem is solved in scetion 4.


Doubts -
1)diffrence betwwen component isntace and component refrence
2)hostViw vs embedd view
