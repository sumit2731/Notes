flex takes 3 individual values:
    flex-grow, as a unitless value (eg. 1)
    flex-shrink, as a unitless value (eg. 5)
    flex-basis, as a length unit (eg. 200px)

    flex: 1 will assign flex-grow: 1, but it will also set flex-basis: 0. It won't affect the default value for flex-shrink, 
        which is 1.()

    if we sepcify only single value then it chnages flex-grow and flex-basis(sets flex-basis to 0).
    if we specify 2 values , it affects flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.


here we saw the trick to make equal size column, this can be used to divide sapce between any no of columns.
    we set flex-basis: 0 and then use flex-grow:1 to make them equal size.

Exercise 1 -

    problem -
        We had 3 child, each child contains a image and some text. we want to be arrange in 3 equal sized columns.
        also images should scale depending upon width of columns.
    solution -
        regarding image scaling read this - https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/06-typography-and-media/15-flexbox-interactions

        later we saw that for very smaller size, we do not have equal widths.this happens because smallest word in columns
            is of equal size and flex-basis: 0px, cannot set width smaller than min-content width. we can overcome this problem
            by setting min-width:0, now columns are always of equal width but now content overflows. which looks ugly.there
            are 2 solutions to problem -

            a)use flex-wrap, so that each content goes to separate row.
            b)use @media queries to change layout for smaller screens.
