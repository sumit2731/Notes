5)you solved the problem but course solution is little better approach.
7)I solved the questions but course solution is also good.have a look at it.
8)After solving 7 this was natural, try to solve directly this one.
9)good question, but i solved it.
10)i solved the qquestion with same complexity as cousre solution, but got many typos on it. also curse solution is
    alternate approach having same complexity.



2nd try -
    3)I solved it but course solution is better.
    10)Solved it but missed a edge case. also course solution is clean.



Start Problems -
    3)
    5)
    7) see patteern for finding permutations in another string with charDic -. 
        we maintain count of matchedChars, when matched chars = count of chars in pattern, we have a count.
    8) AFter solving 7, you get idea. try solving this directly
    9)
    10)course solution is better
