43)Integration test
    If you are combining multiple modules,multiple units or multiple functions
    Ways to write integration test -
        a)write unit test for function that uses another functions(like src/utils/numbers.test.js)
        b)In test we can call multiple functions and use result of multiple functions in combination.

46)Integration vs Unit tests: Finding the right balance
    See testing pyramid

    more unit tests
    then less integration tests
    then least E2E tests


Files Changed - 
    a)added second describe block in src/utils/numbers.test.js

    here we tested a function which calls another function, without using spying and mocks.
    so we tested many units togather, hence the name integration tests.
