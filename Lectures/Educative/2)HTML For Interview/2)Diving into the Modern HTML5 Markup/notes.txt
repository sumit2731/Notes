        layout engines in web browsers -
            Quirk Mode - refers to a strategy used by some web browsers to preserve backward compatibility with web pages built for 
                old web browsers, rather than solely complying with standard W3C and IETF requirements in the standards mode.
            Almost Standards mode - Almost standards" mode rendering matches “full standards” mode in all details except, the image 
                layout inside table cells is treated in the same way that “quirks” mode works.
            Full standards mode - In this mode, the behavior described is the same as described by HTML and CSS specifications. Most 
                of the modern browsers use full standard mode.

    metadata -

        The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.<meta> tags always go 
            inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the 
            document, and viewport settings.Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.Metadata is used by
            browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.There is a method 
            to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag 
            (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).
