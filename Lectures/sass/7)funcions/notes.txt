1)to refer parent selectors when using pseudo selectors we can use & -

    a {
        color: $link-color;

        &:hover {
            color: darken($link-color, 15%);
        }
    }

2) Built in functions-
    a)darken($link-color, 15%) - darkens a color by 15%
    b)lighten(orange, 10%) - lightens a color by 15%
    c)transparentize(#fefefe, 1) - returns a new color
    d)opacify(#fefefe, 0.5) - returns a new color

    there are many,many more functions which are mostly useful to create your own functions, like
     there is a function to get type of value, like its number, color or string.there is function to 
     check if a value is unitless.ther are functions to quote or unquote strings.
