1)first we tested for a element to be present in node.
2)thn we learnt about test suites.
3)then we learnt about how to simulate user events in this simulated DOM.
4)then we learnt asynchronous testing using findAll query which returns promise and we can give some time till this 
    promise will be resolved or rejected.we can make callback passed to test as async and use await keyword to wait 
    for promises to resolve.
5)then we saw how to mock api calling by fetch by using monkey patching.
