Positioned elmenets and overflow
    
    position:absolute -
        positioned elements respect the overflow property of their containing block.This is pretty surprising! In general, 
            absolute positioning is ignored by standard layout algorithms, and yet overflow: auto treats it just like any 
            other element!
    position: fixed -
        No effect on fixed position element.In order for a child to "trigger" the overflow, it needs to be contained by it.
        Setting position: relative is enough to contain an absolute child, but fixed children are only ever contained by 
        the “initial containing block”, a box that exists outside the DOM structure.
