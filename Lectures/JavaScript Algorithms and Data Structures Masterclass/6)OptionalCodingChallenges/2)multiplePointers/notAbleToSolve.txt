Iteration 1 -

    I faced dificulty in problem 3. I was able to solve it, but solution was not as optimized as in course.


    Educative Problem -

        1)here see problem 3. see how we transfered problem to  finding a pair. then see approach of finding a pair.


    Tobe looked later -

        educative problem 4

Iteration 2-

    educative 2-
        a) problem 1 is good, but i solved it.
        b)problem 3 is good, test cases were passed but solution was not entirely correct, i.e it was taking more iteration 
            than required.

Iteration 3 -

    educative problem -

        a)took some time in problem no.7 , but finally solved it.
