First we saw order of cascading. see figure 1.
then we dived deep into 1)important and origin.
then we saw why we should not use px unts for setting font-size on html tag. as it will dsiable user fotn-size. we should use
    rem or %.

then we saw which styles wins based on origin and specificity , then we saw what happens when animations and transitions
come into play.

then we saw how when to use important, like when we want to disable animations, transitions in media query or by browser 
    extension.

Then we saw specificity -

1)It's best to keep specificity flat i.e keep everything as a single class selectr.avoid id' nested selectors and double
    selectors like this-

    .class1.class2 {

    }

keeping specificty help us to rmove one of 3 rules.

but that is like putting training wheels on, once you learned the bike then you can drop the training wheels.then
we talked that little bit of nesting is okay.

then we talked about speciificity link. there we looked ::not is pseudo class but it does not increase the specificity of
selector, but any selector inside() of not increases the specificity.
