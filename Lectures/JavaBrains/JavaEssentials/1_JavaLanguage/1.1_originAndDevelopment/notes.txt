    Different machine will have different run time. you need to install a run time, then that will run
        any .class(byte) code.
Fig 3 (Language vs RunTime) -
    Bytecode is run on JVM (java virtual machine), JVM sits on top of actual machine and understand 
        this .class files.today we can write code in bunch of other languages like scala or groovy
        they have compilers which also compile to same .class files , then JVM runs those .class files.
