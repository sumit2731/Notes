Cold Observable-
    a)Producer is created by observable itself
    b)Data is created from within Observable itself
    c)There truly is not data being produced until the observable is subscribed to.
    d)When a cold observable has multiple subscribers, the whole data stream is re-emitted
        for each subscriber. Each subscriber becomes independent and gets its own stream of 
        data.
    e)observables created using the of, from, range, interval and timer operators will be cold
    f)unicast

Hot Observables-
    a)Their data producer is outside the observable itself,These observables are closing over external data producers
    b)observables created with the fromEvent operator for either user events (clicks, mouse moves,…) or WebSocket 
        events are hot observables
    c)The data is being produced regardless of if there’s a subscriber or not.If there’s no subscriber when the data is 
        being produced, the data is simply lost.

Hot vs Cold Observables-


1)Cold Observable- 
    An observable is “cold” if its underlying producer is created and 
        activated during subscription. This means, that if observables are functions, 
        then the producer is created and activated by calling that function.

    a)creates the producer
    b)activates the producer
    c)starts listening to the producer
    d)unicast


2)Hot Observable- 
    An observable is “hot” if its underlying producer is either created or activated outside of 
        subscription.

    a)shares a reference to a producer
    b)starts listening to the producer
    c)multicast (usually²)
