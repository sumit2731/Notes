Different formats -
    a)Named Colors
        HTML comes with 140 named colors. These are special keyword values like dodgerblue, hotpink, and tomato.
        we generally don't use named colors in production applications. 140 colors just isn't enough

    b)RGB - red green blue.
        color: rgb(255 0 0);
            here each value can range form 0 to 255 and represents the brightness of corrospnding color.
            The rgb color format also allows us to specify a 4th optional value for the alpha channel, to control transparency.
            The alpha channel ranges from 0 (fully invisible) to 1 (fully opaque).

        background: rgb(255 0 0 / 0.5);

    c)HexCodes - a 6-digit hex code contains three 2-digit values, one for each channel (red / green / blue). Instead of using a 10-digit 
        decimal system, it uses a 16-digit hexadecimal system.Fundamentally, hex codes are the same as RGB values. In both cases, we're 
        providing a value for red, green, and blue.

        color: #2E0000
        
        And here's a fun fact: we can pass an eight digit hex code if we want to include an alpha channel(IE does not support)

        background: #FFFF0080;

    d)HSL(reccommneded one) -
        This color format takes 3 different values:
            
            Hue: This is the pigment we want to use. Valid values range from 0 to 360.
            
            Saturation: How much pigment is in the color? Valid values range from 0% to 100%. At 0%, there is no pigment in the color,  and   it's totally grayscale. At 100%, the color is as vibrant as possible.

            Lightness: how light/dark is the color? Valid values range from 0% to 100%. At 0%, the color is pitch black. At 100%, the color is pure white.
                
                background-color: hsl(360deg 42% 67%);

            Like we saw with RGB, we can specify transparency with the / delimiter:

                background: hsl(0deg 100% 50% / 0.5);
