1)I solved in n*n complexity but course solution is in n Logn complexity. course solution is better
2)course solution is cleaner approach. but my solution also have same complexity.
3)I solved this question, also course solution follows similar approach. howveer i missed i edge case.
4)i solved it. but in 4.2 i missed a edge case, which i then corrected also. course solution also misses
    that edge case.
5)i solved it using array, course used minHeap. so course solution is better.it use binary heap to solve the problem.
    see simliar problems for this. they tend to be non intitutive.

7)not able to solve question. course solution offers diffrent approaches.
