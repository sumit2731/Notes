Import the module (its code runs), but do not assign any of its exports to variables:

    import "module"



Syntax -

    1)We can put import/export statements at the top or at the bottom of a script, that doesn’t matter.

        So, technically this code is fine:


            sayHi();

            // ...

            import {sayHi} from './say.js'; // import at the end of the file

        In practice imports are usually at the start of the file, but that’s only for more convenience


    2)Please note that import/export statements don’t work if inside {...}.
        A conditional import, like this, won’t work:

        if (something) {
        import {sayHi} from "./say.js"; // Error: import must be at top level
}
