transform: rotate(90deg) scale(2) translate(100px, 200px);


rotate - A positive value will result in a clockwise rotate and a negative value will result in a 
    counter-clockwise rotation.we used both deg and turn units to define our rotation. deg units
    are from 0 to 360 while the turn unit goes from 0 to 1.

    .red {
        transform: rotate(10deg);
    }

    .green {
        transform: rotate(-45deg);
    }

    .blue {
        transform: rotate(0.25turn);
    }


    3D Rotation -  3D rotation by using the rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ functions. The rotateZ 
        function works exactly the same as rotate.


scale - It can take either one or two parameters.When one parameter is passed to scale it scales the
    X and Y axis the same amount based on the number passed. When two values are passed to scale the
    first number will scale the X axis and the second number will scale the Y axis.

    .red {
        transform: scale(1.25);
    }

    .green {
        transform: scale(0.5);
    }

    .blue {
        transform: scale(1.25, 0.75);
    }


    if you want you can use the scaleX and scaleY functions to just scale the X or Y axis.


    3d scale - Just like with rotate you can scale in 3D. To do this you would use the scaleZ function
        which works just like scaleX and scaleY, but for the Z axis. This again is only useful with 
        3D elements.


translate - 

    a)when just one value is passed to translate it only effects the X axis so the element is
        moved 25 pixels to the right since it is a positive value.

    b)When two values are passed to translate the first one moves the element in the X axis and the
        second effects the Y axis position.

    c)Just like scale, there are a translateX and translateY functions for moving an element in just
        one direction at a time.

        .red {
            transform: translate(25px);
        }

        .green {
            transform: translate(-25px, 25px);
        }

        .blue {
            transform: translate(0, -25px);
        }


    Percentage Translation - percentage value is relative to element ,not to its parent.
        The translate property handles percentages differently than nearly every other CSS property
            since it is based on the element’s size and not its parent’s size.

    3D Translate - translateZ function which modifies just the Z axis or the translate3D function
        which works just like translate, but accepts a third argument for moving an element in the
        Z axis.


skew - specifying one parameter we skew on only the X direction while if we pass two properties the 
    first one skews in the X direction and the second one skews in the Y direction.

    you can use skewX and skewY to skew an element in one direction without affecting the other 
    directions.

    Unlike, all the other transform properties, skew does not have any 3D version.


Combining different things -
    Combining these can be problem, but CSS variables comes handly here.
