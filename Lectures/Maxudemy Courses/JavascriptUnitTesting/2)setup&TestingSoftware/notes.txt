Things needed for testing -

    See figure 1
    a)Test runner
        eg - Jest,Karma
    b)Assertion Library
        eg -Jest,Chai

JEST vs VITEST -
    We will use VITEST in this course because JEST can be slow. and JEST has experimnetal support of ESMModules. codes get transpiled
        behind the scenes.this is not good. we should always test the code that we are going to ship to prod. also VITEST syntax
        is compatoble with JEST.

    Vitest is both a test runner and an assertion library.

Installing Vitest -

    "scripts" : {
        "test": "vitest --globals"
    }

    globals flags lets you use things like 'it' and 'expect' without any imports.
