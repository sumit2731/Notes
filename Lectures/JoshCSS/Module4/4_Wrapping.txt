we want to have equal size columns so we set flex-basis:0 and flex:grow to one. but when we decrease the window size, items 
    cannot shrink below their min-width(length of longest word) and we had scroll bar, in order to avoid this, we used 
    flex-wrap:wrap property,now instead of having scroll bar some flex-items go to next row.note here flex-basis:0, content 
    moves to next row purely depending upon min-width.

but really small columns does not look good so we set some flex-basis instead of 0%. now element line wraps when there is not 
    enough width to give hypothetical size to element.For single element still flex-shrink comes to picture and if flex-shrink
    is 0 then we will have scroll bar.

but still when there is single element in row it occupies whole row(as we have flex-grow:1 to make columns in same row of equal size)
    and looks bit weird. there is no perfect solution to this but we can use max-width to make it bit more managable.

align-items vs align-content

    justify - along main axis
    align - along cross axis
     
    content - group of items
    items - individual item, item is positioned on its own

    In case of multiple rows align-items only moves the items within it's own row. if you want to move the entire rows then use
    align-content.

flex-shrink vs flex-wrap

    If we also have flex-shrink with flex-wrap, then sinfle item is in row, it's size will shrink.
    so wrapping is done on basis for flex-basis not on flex-shrink. flex-shrink comes into picture when there is a single item
    in row.

    Also if no flex-basis is not mentioned then it's default value is auto. Here item will move to next row, when all text is not
        coming in single row.
